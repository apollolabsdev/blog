## Introduction

Dealing with interrupts on its own from an embedded microcontroller perspective is more complex than polled code. As if that weren't enough, I would say the use of Rust adds another level of complexity. This is understandable because interrupts are not safe by definition since they introduce race conditions. As a result, Rust being Rust, adds abstractions to make interrupt operations safe and prevent these race conditions. These additional abstractions might not be easy to digest for a beginner. Still, the good news is that there are alternatives out there to make using Rust with interrupts smoother. This includes the Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency (RTIC) framework and the embassy framework.

In this post, I will be refactoring the [GPIO button-controlled blinking](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-gpio-button-controlled-blinking) application I created before and transforming it to use interrupts. I will be sticking strictly to the HAL. Along the way, I will try my best to explain the elements introduced by Rust.

## üë®‚Äçüé® Software Design

In the application developed in this post, I want to cycle through several LED blinking frequencies based on a button press. Meaning, that every time I press the on-board button, I want to see the LED turning on and off at a different rate. In this section, I will focus on the design of the application algorithm itself rather than the configuration aspects. For algorithm design purposes, I will assume that interrupts are configured already. I will be detailing the configuration steps in the implementation section.

I've decided it would be best to represent the algorithm using a state machine. Here's one possible approach:

![Algorithmic State Machine](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1660913041210/D-OU4bg3J.png align="center")

**üìù Note**

> Although I use state machine representation. I will not be encoding any states in the code. Additionally, the representation assumes that configuration is already completed.

Let's analyze what is happening here. The application will start in a state where the LED is turned on. In this state, a timer would also be started. While in the "LED on" state two events could happen to make the system transition to another state; either a button press or a timer delay expiration. If the delay expires the application would transition to an "LED off" state that turns off the LED and resets the delay timer. On the other hand, if a button press is detected the application would transition to a "Button Pressed" state. The "Button Pressed" state would in turn adjust the amount of timer delay and then return to the state it transitioned from. The "LED off" state has exactly the same transition conditions as the "LED on" state.

In essence, interrupts are software routines that are triggered by hardware events. As such, this application can be programmed to run entirely on interrupts. This means that both hardware events causing transitions (button press and timer expiry) can be configured with interrupts. However, I won't be doing that, instead I will configure the application to use GPIO interrupts only for the button press.

Let's now jump into implementing this algorithm.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Code Implementation

Before jumping in, I'd like to provide some context on what needs to be done for configuring interrupts in hardware and software. The hardware part is more or less the same across controllers that use a certain architecture. For embedded controllers typically the following steps need to be done to configure interrupts:

* Configure and enable local interrupt behavior.
    
* Enable interrupts at the peripheral/device level.
    
* Enable global interrupts at the processor level.
    

After that, one would need to define an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) in the application code. As one would expect, the ISR contains the code executed in response to a specific interrupt event. Additionally, inside the ISR, it is typical that one would use values that are shared with the `main` routine. Also in the ISR, one would have to clear the hardware pending interrupt flag to allow consecutive interrupts to happen. This is a bit of a challenge in Rust for two reasons; First, to clear the pending flag one would need to access the peripheral through its handle. This is an issue because if you recall, Rust follows a singleton pattern and we cannot have more than one reference to a peripheral. Second, in Rust, global mutable variables, rightly so, are considered unsafe to read or write. This is because without taking special care, a race condition might be triggered. To solve both challenges, in Rust, global mutable data and peripherals need to be wrapped in safe abstractions that allow them to be shared between the ISR and the main thread. Enough explanations, lets move on to the actual code.

### üì• Crate Imports

In this implementation the crates required are as follows:

* The `core` crate to import the `Cell` and `RefCell` pointer constructs.
    
* The `critical_section` crate to import the `Mutex` construct.
    
* The `esp32c3_hal` crate to import the ESP32C3 device hardware abstractions.
    
* The `esp_backtrace` crate to define the panicking behavior.
    
* The `esp_println` crate to provide `println!` implementation.
    

```rust
use core::cell::{Cell, RefCell};
use critical_section::Mutex;
use esp32c3_hal::{
    clock::ClockControl,
    esp_riscv_rt::entry,
    gpio::{Event, Gpio0, Input, PullUp},
    // gpio_types::{Event, Input, Pin, PullDown},
    interrupt,
    // pac::{Interrupt, Peripherals},
    prelude::*,
    soc::peripherals::{Interrupt, Peripherals},
    timer::TimerGroup,
    Delay,
    Rtc,
    IO,
};
use esp_backtrace as _;
use esp_println::println;
```

#### üåç Global Variables

In the application at hand, I'm choosing to enable interrupts for the GPIO peripheral to detect a button press. As such, I would need to create a global shared variable to access the GPIO peripheral (remember the singleton pattern). This is because I would need to subsequently disable the interrupt pending flag in the ISR. In particular, I will be using `Gpio0` as the GPIO input pin that I want to enable interrupts for. For that I create a `static` global variable called `G_BUTTON` wrapping `Gpio0` in a safe abstraction as follows:

```rust
static G_BUTTON: Mutex<RefCell<Option<Gpio0<Input<PullUp>>>>> = Mutex::new(RefCell::new(None));
```

So here the peripheral is wrapped in an `Option` that is wrapped in a `RefCell`, that is wrapped in a `Mutex`. The `Mutex` makes sure that the peripheral can be safely shared among threads. This means it would require that we use a critical section every time we want to access the peripheral. The `RefCell` is used to be able to obtain a mutable reference to the peripheral. Finally, the `Option` is used to allow for lazy initialization as one would not be able to initialize the variable until later (after I configure the GPIO button).

Next, I create a global variable `G_DELAYMS` to carry the delay value that I'm going to pass around for determining the blinking delay. This is a variable that will be used by the main thread and modified by the ISR. I initialize the delay to `2000_u32` which will correspond to two seconds.

```rust
static G_DELAYMS: Mutex<Cell<u32>> = Mutex::new(Cell::new(2000_u32));
```

Note two differences here from the peripheral global variable. First, I am not using an `Option` since I am directly initializing with a value. Second, I am using a `Cell` rather than a `RefCell`. This is because `Cell` only permits taking a copy of the current value or replacing it, not taking a reference which is not needed with a `u32`.

**üìù Notes:**

> 1Ô∏è‚É£ These global variables can be viewed as entities that exist in a global context where access is obtained at runtime by the thread that needs them. This is why `RefCell` is needed. Compared to a `Box`, `RefCell` allows for checking during runtime that only one mutable reference exists to a variable. A `Box` makes sure statically at compile time that only one mutable reference exists. Obviously `Box` cannot be used with interrupts as multiple threads would require mutable access during runtime.

> 2Ô∏è‚É£ I would strongly recommend referring to [Chapter 6 of the Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/concurrency/index.html) for more detail on this topic.

### üéõ Peripheral Configuration Code

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the device peripherals**: In embedded Rust, as part of the singleton design pattern, we first have to take the PAC level device peripherals. This is done using the `take()` method. Here I create a device peripheral handler named `dp` as follows:

```rust
let peripherals = Peripherals::take();
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Disable the Watchdogs:** The ESP32C3 has watchdogs enabled by default and they need to be disabled. If they are not disabled then the device would keep on resetting. I'm not going to go into much detail, however, watchdogs require the application software to periodically "kick" them to avoid resets. This is out of the scope of this example, though to avoid this issue, the following code needs to be included:

```rust
let mut system = peripherals.SYSTEM.split();
let clocks = ClockControl::boot_defaults(system.clock_control).freeze();

let mut rtc = Rtc::new(peripherals.RTC_CNTL);
let timer_group0 = TimerGroup::new(
        peripherals.TIMG0,
        &clocks,
        &mut system.peripheral_clock_control,
);
let mut wdt0 = timer_group0.wdt;
let timer_group1 = TimerGroup::new(
        peripherals.TIMG1,
        &clocks,
        &mut system.peripheral_clock_control,
);
let mut wdt1 = timer_group1.wdt;

rtc.swd.disable();
rtc.rwdt.disable();
wdt0.disable();
wdt1.disable();
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Instantiate and Create Handle for IO**: We need to configure the LED pin as a push-pull output and obtain a handler for the pin so that we can control it. We also need to obtain a handle for the button input pin. Before we can obtain any handles for the LED and the button we need to create an `IO` struct instance. The `IO` struct instance provides a HAL-designed struct that gives us access to all gpio pins thus enabling us to create handles for individual pins. This is similar to the concept of a `split` method used in other HALs (more detail [**here**](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/demystifying-rust-embedded-hal-split-and-constrain-methods)). We do this by calling the `new()` instance method on the `IO` struct as follows:

```rust
let io = IO::new(peripherals.GPIO, peripherals.IO_MUX);
```

Note how the `new` method requires passing the `GPIO` and `IO_MUX` peripherals.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the LED and configure it to an output**: As earlier stated, the LED is connected to pin 4 (`gpio4`). As such, we need to create a handle for the LED pin that has `gpio4` configured to a push-pull output using the `into_push_pull_output()` method. We will name the handle `led` and configure it as follows:

```rust
let mut led = io.pins.gpio4.into_push_pull_output();
```

For those interested, [**this**](https://docs.rs/esp32c3-hal/latest/esp32c3_hal/gpio/struct.GpioPin.html) HAL documentation page has the full list of methods that the `GpioPin` type supports.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle and configure the input button**: The push button is connected to pin 0 (`gpio0`) as stated earlier. Additionally, in the pressed state, the button pulls to ground. Also, for the button unpressed state, a pull-up resistor needs to be included so the pin goes high. An internal pull-up can be configured for the pin using the `into_pull_up_input()` method as follows:

```rust
let button = io.pins.gpio0.into_pull_up_input();
```

Note that as opposed to the LED output, the `button` handle here does not need to be mutable since we will only be reading it.

#### ‚è± Timer Delay Configuration:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the delay**: I'll be using the hal `Delay` type to create a delay handle as follows:

```rust
let mut delay = Delay::new(&clocks);
```

#### ‚è∏ Interrupt Configuration Code

The last thing that remains in the configuration is to configure and enable interrupt operation for the GPIO button peripheral. This is so that when a button is pressed, execution switches over to the interrupt service routine. As mentioned earlier we need to configure the hardware in three steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure button press interrupt**: To set up the interrupts for GPIO we need to use the `Pin` type `listen()` method. `listen` takes one argument that is an enum defining the type of `Event`. In this case, I chose a `FallingEdge`:

```rust
button.listen(Event::FallingEdge);
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Set up and enable interrupts at the peripheral level** : To enable interrupts, the hal `interrupt` module has an `enable` function that accepts two arguments. The first argument is an `Interrupt` enum that defines the source of the interrupt to enable. The second argument is a `Priority` enum that specifies the priority of the interrupt.

```rust
interrupt::enable(Interrupt::GPIO, interrupt::Priority::Priority3).unwrap();
```

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable global interrupts**: enabling global interrupts is done through an `enable` function embedded within the `esp_riscv_rt` core module. Specifically the `enable` function is embedded in the `esp32c3_hal::esp_riscv_rt::riscv::interrupt` module. Unmasking global interrupts is considered `unsafe` and thus needs to be wrapped in an `unsafe` block:

```rust
unsafe {
    esp32c3_hal::esp_riscv_rt::riscv::interrupt::enable();
}
```

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Move Button to Global Context**: Recall how earlier a global variable `G_BUTTON` was introduced to move around the GPIO peripheral between contexts. However, `G_BUTTON` was initialized with `None` pending the configuration of the GPIO button that is now available. This means that we can now move `button` to the global context in which it can be shared by threads. This is done as follows:

```rust
critical_section::with(|cs| G_BUTTON.borrow_ref_mut(cs).replace(button));
```

Here we are introducing a critical section of code enclosed in the closure `critcal_section::with`. In this critical section of code, preemption from interrupts is disabled to ensure that accessing the global variable does not introduce any race conditions. This is required because `G_BUTTON` is wrapped in a `Mutex`. The closure passes a token `cs` that allows us to `borrow` a mutable reference to the global variable and replace the `Option` inside of with `Some(button)`.

Note that from this point on in code, every time we want to access `G_BUTTON` (or any other `Mutex` global variable we would need to introduce a critical section using `critcal_section::with`.

This was a lot, though its over and we can move on to the application code.

### üì± Application Code

#### üîÅ Application Loop

Following the design described earlier in the state machine, the button press will be the only event that is interrupt based. Meaning that the delay expiry events will be managed in the application loop. Consequently, in the application loop, all I will be doing is switching between the "LED on" and "LED off" states with a delay in between them. However, the delay value would depend on the value in `G_DELAYMS` that exists in the global context. `G_DELAYMS` is modified by the ISR everytime a button press is detected.

In the application loop, I switch between the "LED on" and "LED off" states using the `set_high()` and `set_low()` `Pin` methods. In between the "LED on" and "LED off" states, a delay is required which I used the `delay` handle I created earlier. In order to obtain access to `G_DELAYMS` I would need to introduce a critical section as done earlier since it's wrapped in a `Mutex`. Inside the critical section, I obtain access by borrowing `G_DELAYMS` using the `borrow` method and then getting its value using the `get` method. The application loop code looks as follows:

```rust
loop {
    // Turn On LED
    led.set_high().unwrap();
    // Acquire updated G_DELAYMS and delay
    delay.delay_ms(critical_section::with(|cs| G_DELAYMS.borrow(cs).get()));
    // Turn off LED
    led.set_low().unwrap();
    // Acquire updated G_DELAYMS and delay
    delay.delay_ms(critical_section::with(|cs| G_DELAYMS.borrow(cs).get()));
}
```

#### ‚è∏ Interrupt Service Routine(s)

Next, I need to set up the ISR that would include the code that executes once the interrupt is detected. To define the interrupt in Rust, first one would need to use the `#[interrupt]` attribute, followed by a function definition that has the interrupt name as an identifier. The interrupt name is obtained from the hal documentation and in our case for GPIO is `GPIO`. This looks as follows:

```rust
#[interrupt]
fn GPIO() {
  // Interrupt Service Routine Code
}
```

Inside the ISR, first thing that needs to be done is modifying the `G_DELAYMS` delay. In this application, I chose to start with a delay of 2 seconds and decrease it in 0.5 second decrements. If the delay value reaches zero then I reset it again to 2 seconds. Though as before, to access `G_DELAYMS`, a critical section is needed. Additionally, I am using a new `set` method that allows me to modify the contents of `G_DELAYMS`.

```rust
critical_section::with(|cs| {
    G_DELAYMS
        .borrow(cs)
        .set(G_DELAYMS.borrow(cs).get() - 500_u32);
    if G_DELAYMS.borrow(cs).get() < 500_u32 {
        G_DELAYMS.borrow(cs).set(2000_u32);
    }
```

We are not done yet, as the interrupt pending flag for the button press in the hardware is still set. If it is not reset, then we won't be able to detect any subsequent interrupts. For that, we would need a reference to the GPIO button peripheral which can be provided by the `G_BUTTON` global variable created earlier. As a result, in the same critical section started earlier the following lines can be added:

```rust
G_BUTTON
  .borrow_ref_mut(cs)
  .as_mut()
  .unwrap()
  .clear_interrupt();
```

The first line obtains a mutable reference to the `Option` in `G_BUTTON` using the `borrow_mut` method. In the following line, the mutable reference is unwrapped, providing access to the `button` handle. Finally, the `clear_interrupt` method is applied to clear the interrupt pending flag/bit.

## üî¨ Further Experimentation/Ideas

* If you have extra buttons, try implementing additional interrupts from other input pins where each button press applies a different delay. This is instead of one button applying one delay.
    
* A cool mini project is capturing a human response time. Using the LED and a press button, see how long it takes you to press the button after the LED turns on. You can use a counter/timer peripheral to capture duration and a serial monitor to propagate the result. For serial monitor and `println!` functionality, one can use the `esp_println` crate.
    

## Conclusion

In this post, an interrupt-based LED control application was created leveraging the GPIO peripheral for the ESP32C3 . All code was created at the HAL level using the Rust esp32c3-hal. It can be seen that doing interrupts in Rust can be a bit verbose for all the added safe abstractions. For that, one can instead resort to frameworks like RTIC or embassy to reduce verbosity.
