## Introduction

The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is another type of serial communication standard commonly used in embedded. SPI facilitates high-speed full-duplex transactions that are useful in applications that require large bandwidth such as memory interfaces and displays. An example device that utilizes a SPI interface is the [MAX7219](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/MAX7219-MAX7221.pdf). The [MAX7219](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/MAX7219-MAX7221.pdf) is an integrated circuit (IC) designed to control and drive a matrix of LEDs, typically in the form of a 7-segment display or a dot matrix display. It is widely used to interface microcontrollers and digital devices with LED displays for various applications such as digital clocks, scoreboards, message boards, and more.

In this blog post, I'll be working with the [MAX7219](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX7219-MAX7221.pdf) 8-digit LED display driver. As such, I'll be using the ESP32C3 and the `esp-idf-hal` to configure and control the SPI peripheral to control the MAX7219.

## **üë®‚Äçüé®** Software Design

All that the application software will do is draw a diagonal line on the 8x8 LED matrix then erase it and draw it again. Ahead of that, all the steps involved will be to initialize and configure the MAX7219 so that it can be used. What steps need to be taken for configuration all come from the datasheet. Ahead of that though, let's take a look at a couple of things. First is the internal block diagram of the MAX7219:

![max7219 block diagram](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664034317499/qDrikBr2R.png align="center")

In this description, I will focus on the details needed for our application. This is because the MAX7219 offers several configurations and options. Interested readers can refer to the [datasheet](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX7219-MAX7221.pdf) for more intimate details.

In the MAX7219, there are 16-bits of data that get clocked in MSB first using SPI while the CS signal is low. After all the data is clocked in, the CS signal is driven high to latch the data. A portion of those latched-in bits is used as an address (bits D8-D11) and another portion as data for command (bits D0-D7). The rest of the bits (D12-D15) are simply ignored. The MAX7219 also allows for chaining multiple display matrices side by side by connecting the DOUT on one device to the DIN of the next device.

When showing data (turning on LEDs in the matrix) the address part selects what digit we want to show and the data controls which segments are turned on. As shown in the diagram, there are 7-segment driver pins (and a decimal point) and 8-digit driver pins.

Now let's take a look at the schematic showing how the LED dot matrix is connected to the MAX7219:

![max7219schematic.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664033795046/X_UpOYdpa.png align="center")

If you notice, the segment pins of the MAX7219 are connected to the LED matrix rows, and the digit pins are connected to the LED matrix columns. As such, the way the MAX7219 operates, it will allow us to cycle through digits (or columns) turning on/off any segment (or LEDs) in any digit.

#### MAX7219 Initialization Sequence

Reading into the MAX7219 [datasheet](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX7219-MAX7221.pdf), the following steps need to be taken to initialize the device for usage:

1. Write `0x01` to address `0x0C` to power up the MAX7219
    
2. Write `0x00` to address `0x09` to put the MAX7219 in "No Decode" mode (see notes)
    
3. Write `0x07` to address `0x0B` removing any scan limit (see notes)
    
4. Write `0x07` to address `0x0A` choosing a medium light intensity for the LEDs
    

**üìù Notes**

> * The "No Decode" mode is the one necessary for driving an LED matrix. Other modes are ones used for driving seven segment displays.
>     
> * The scan limit controls how many digits are activated (displayed) in the case of hooking up the MAX7219 to seven segment displays. In the case of the LED dot matrix, however, the scan limit affects how many rows can be activated. Obviously, in the case of the 8x8 dot matrix, all rows need to be shown. However, this is a feature when connecting a series of seven segment displays, in some cases, some digits need not be used.
>     

#### LED Matrix Control Sequence

Like I had mentioned earlier all that the code will be doing is activate the LEDs diagonally one at a time then deactivate them again. These are the steps:

1. Initialize a variable `x` to keep track of the column and row index and initialize it with a value of `1`.
    
2. Activate LED `x` in row `x`
    
3. Delay 500 ms
    
4. Increment column and row index `(x = x + 1)`
    
5. If the last row is reached (`x = 8`) reset `x` back to 1 else go back to step 2
    
6. Deactivate all the LEDs in the row `x`
    
7. Delay 500 ms
    
8. Increment column and row index `(x = x + 1)`
    
9. If the last row is reached (`x = 8`) reset `x` back to 1 else go back to step 1
    

It becomes clear that it would be convenient to wrap this implementation in some sort of loop. Let's move on to the implementation to see what the code looks like.

## **üë®‚Äçüíª** Code Implementation

### **üì•** Crate Imports

In this implementation, the following crates are required:

* The `embedded-hal` crate to import spi configuration parameters.
    
* The `esp_idf_hal` crate to import the needed device hardware abstractions.
    

```rust
use embedded_hal::spi::*;
use esp_idf_hal::delay::FreeRtos;
use esp_idf_hal::gpio;
use esp_idf_hal::peripherals::Peripherals;
use esp_idf_hal::prelude::*;
use esp_idf_hal::spi::config::Config;
use esp_idf_hal::spi::*;
```

### **üéõ Initialization/Configuration Code**

#### SPI Peripheral Configuration:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the device peripherals**: Similar to all past blog posts, in embedded Rust, as part of the singleton design pattern, we first have to take the device peripherals. This is done using the `take()` method. Here I create a device peripheral handler named `peripherals` as follows:

```rust
let peripherals = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain handles for SCLK, MOSI, and CS pins**: Here I need to configure and obtain handles for the SCLK, MOSI, and CS pins so that they can be controlled by the SPI peripheral. As shown earlier, the SCLK, MOSI, and CS pins are connected to `gpio0`, `gpio2`, and `gpio3`, respectively. As such, I obtain handles for `sclk`, `mosi` and `cs` as follows:

```rust
let sclk = peripherals.pins.gpio0;
let mosi = peripherals.pins.gpio2;
let cs = peripherals.pins.gpio3;
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Instantiate a SPI Driver**: In the `esp-idf-hal` SPI is configured in two steps. The first step involves instantiating a `SPIDriver` followed by a `SPIDeviceDriver` . The `SPIDriver` defines the peripheral instance to be used, the pins, and configurations like dma. The `SPIDeviceDriver` on the other hand, configures SPI behavior like modes, baudrate, and bit order, among others. In this application, we're going to use `SPI2` since `SPI0` and `SPI1` have restrictions according to the [documentation](https://esp-rs.github.io/esp-idf-hal/esp_idf_hal/spi/index.html).

To configure/instantiate we need to use use the `new` method in the `SPIDriver` abstraction struct to instantiate a `SPI2` instance. If we examine the `new` method signature in `SPIDriver`, it looks like this:

```rust
pub fn new<SPI: SpiAnyPins>(
    _spi: impl Peripheral<P = SPI> + 'd,
    sclk: impl Peripheral<P = impl OutputPin> + 'd,
    sdo: impl Peripheral<P = impl OutputPin> + 'd,
    sdi: Option<impl Peripheral<P = impl InputPin + OutputPin> + 'd>,
    config: &DriverConfig
) -> Result<Self, EspError>
```

The method takes five parameters, a spi instance, pins instances, and a `DriverConfig` instance reference. As such, we can create a handle `spi_drv` for `spi2` as follows:

```rust
let spi_drv = SpiDriver::new(
    peripherals.spi2,
    sclk,
    mosi,
    None::<gpio::AnyIOPin>,
    &SpiDriverConfig::new(),
)
.unwrap();
```

A couple of things to note, first is that since the communication is in one direction I don't need to pass a pin instance to `sdi` (serial input or MISO). As a result, I am passing a `None::<gpio::AnyIOPin>` since `sdi` requires an `Option`. The type annotation is necessary because the compiler would otherwise blow an error. Second, is that I by instantiating a `SpiDriverConfig` using it's `new` method, I am electing for the default configuration which is sufficient for our application.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure the SPI peripheral channel**: This is the second step to configure SPI behavior using the `SPIDeviceDriver`. In our case, there are two items we need to configure, the baud rate and the mode according to the MAX7219 specification. `SPIDeviceDriver` has a `new` method that takes three parameters, an instance of a `SPIDriver`, an instance of a (cs) pin, and a `spi::config::Config` configuration as follows:

```rust
pub fn new(
    driver: T,
    cs: Option<impl Peripheral<P = impl OutputPin> + 'd>,
    config: &Config
) -> Result<Self, EspError>
```

Additionally, the `Config` struct contains several members allowing us to configure the SPI driver and is defined as follows:

```rust
pub struct Config {
    pub baudrate: Hertz,
    pub data_mode: Mode,
    pub write_only: bool,
    pub duplex: Duplex,
    pub bit_order: BitOrder,
    pub cs_active_high: bool,
    pub input_delay_ns: i32,
}
```

Looking into the source code, the `Config` struct defaults are sufficient except for the `baudrate` and the `data_mode`. For convenience, I create a separate handle `config` for the SPI configuration as follows:

```rust
let config = Config::new().baudrate(2.MHz().into()).data_mode(Mode {
    polarity: Polarity::IdleLow,
    phase: Phase::CaptureOnFirstTransition,
});
```

The `baudrate` and the `mode` are configured according to the MAX7219 requirements. Both `Polarity` and `Phase` are enums with different options. In my instance, I chose the `Polarity::IdleLow` option and `Phase::CaptureOnFirstTransition` option. The choices correspond to what is known as SPI Mode 0 which is what the MAX7219 datasheet defines as the mode of operation. Additionally, the MAX7219 datasheet states that the device can handle up to 10 MHz as a maximum rate so I only chose an arbitrary value of 2 MHz under the stated limit. Following that, I instantiate the `SPIDeviceDriver` and pass the `SPIDriver` handle `spi_drv` , the handle for the `cs` pin, and a reference to the `SPIDeviceDriver` configuration `config`:

```rust
let mut spi = SpiDeviceDriver::new(spi_drv, Some(cs), &config).unwrap();
```

This is it for configuration! Let's now jump into the application code.

### **üì±** Application Code

In the software design described, the first step requires that we write '0x01' to address '0x0C' to power up the MAX7219. As explained earlier, the way data is written to the MAX7219 is by clocking in 16 bits MSB first while the CS line is low. After that, the CS line needs to be asserted to latch the data. To send data over SPI there is a `write` method that has the following signature:

```rust
pub fn write(&mut self, write: &[u8]) -> Result<(), EspError>
```

As can be observed, the `write` method takes a slice of bytes sending everything the slice contains byte after byte. Additionally, in the `write` method takes care of asserting and unasserting the cs pin. As such, to achieve the described earlier, the following code was written:

```rust
// Prepare Data
let data: u8 = 0x01;
let addr: u8 = 0x0C;
let send_array: [u8; 2] = [addr, data];

// Send Data
spi.write(&send_array).unwrap();
```

As can be seen, the 16-bit word is packaged in a single array that is passed into the `write` method so that it can be transmitted while the `write` method keeps CS low. `data` refers to data that is being written to the `addr` address in the MAX7219. After that CS is asserted by `write` to latch the transmitted array. This code is repeated exactly in the same manner with different `addr` and `data` contents for the remaining steps 2, 3, and 4 required to initialize the MAX7219.

All that is left now is to write the code for drawing the diagonal line on the LED matrix. Looking at the steps described earlier, essentially all that needs to be done, is to cycle through addresses/rows 1 to 8 then send 8-bit data that represents individual LEDs/columns to light up. Since we are drawing a diagonal line then one LED needs to be lit up in each row at a time. The LED that is lit will shift one bit to the left as we cycle through the rows. This can be wrapped in a `for` loop as follows:

```rust
let mut data: u8 = 1;
for addr in 1..9 {
      let send_array: [u8; 2] = [addr, data];
      data = data << 1;

      spi.write(&send_array).unwrap();

      FreeRtos::delay_ms(500_u32);
}
```

Note also the delay that is introduced at the end of the loop so that the LEDs can be noticed as they turn on and off. Next, we want to clear the rows one by one so a second similar loop can be introduced as follows:

```rust
for addr in 1..9 {
      let send_array: [u8; 2] = [addr, data];
      spi.write(&send_array).unwrap();
      FreeRtos::delay_ms(500_u32);
}
```

Keep in mind here that `data` already has a zero value from the previous loop, so it does not need to be updated.

This is it!
