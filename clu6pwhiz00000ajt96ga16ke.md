2. [**Embedded Rust Bluetooth on ESP: BLE Advertiser**](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/embedded-rust-bluetooth-on-esp-ble-advertiser)
    

## **Introduction**

In the first two posts of this series, we've dealt with activities conducted pre-connection establishment. This included a **central** device scanning for advertising **peripheral** devices ([BLE Scanner](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/embedded-rust-bluetooth-on-esp-ble-scanner)) and a **peripheral** device advertising its presence to **central** devices ([BLE Advertiser](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/embedded-rust-bluetooth-on-esp-ble-advertiser)). In this post, we want to transition to the post-connection phase. This means that a connection needs to be established first, and then the connected devices assume the roles of **server** and **client** when exchanging data. In this case the devices can start exchanging data in the form of what is known as **attributes**.

In this post, we're going to create a **peripheral** device that will assume the role of a **server** upon connection establishment. Similar to past posts, the code will be built using the [**esp32-nimble** crate.](https://crates.io/crates/esp32-nimble/0.6.0)

### **üìö Knowledge Pre-requisites**

To understand the content of this post, you need the following:

* Basic knowledge of coding in Rust.
    
* Familiarity with standard library development in Rust with the ESP.
    
* Basic knowledge of networking layering concepts/stacks (ex. OSI model).
    
* Basic knowledge of Bluetooth.
    

### **üíæ Software Setup**

All the code presented in this post is available on the [**apollolabs ESP32C3 git repo**](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/ESP32C3). Note that if the code on the git repo is slightly different then it means that it was modified to enhance the code quality or accommodate any HAL/Rust updates.

    #### **üîå Connections**
    
    No connections are required for this example.
    

## **üë®‚Äçüé® Software Design**

### üîó **Connection Establishment & Management**

Once a **central** decides to connect to a **peripheral**, it would send a connection request to the **peripheral**. The **peripheral** would in turn accept the connection and establish a bi-directional communication channel between the two devices. Once a new connection is established, new connection settings/parameters are involved to manage the connection. Notice how in terms of connection management, we are still using the **peripheral** and **central** roles. Some important settings include the following:

1. **Connection Interval:** Recall scan intervals in the pre-connection phase. This is a similar concept, albeit post-connection. The **connection interval** defines how often the **central** device communicates with the **peripheral** device. A shorter **connection interval** allows for more frequent communication, resulting in lower latency but higher power consumption. Conversely, a longer **connection interval** reduces the frequency of communication, resulting in higher latency but lower power consumption. The lower power consumption is a result of the devices going to sleep after all needed packets are exchanged.
    
    The **connection interval** is typically negotiated during the establishment of a connection, but can also be updated during a connection. It is specified in units of 1.25 milliseconds, with allowable values ranging from 7.5 ms to 4,000 ms (or 7.5 ms to 4 seconds).
    
    Within a **connection interval**, there also exists **connection events**. A **connection event**, triggered by a **central** sending a packet, marks the exchange of data between devices to either synchronize their clocks and/or communicate data.

2. **Peripheral Latency:** This allows the **peripheral** device to skip a certain number of connection events (intervals) if it has no data to transmit. This also allows the **peripheral** to conserve power by entering a low-power mode between connection events. One way of viewing this is extending the **connection interval** when theres no data to share.
    
3. **Supervision Timeout:** This limits the duration of inactivity before the connection is considered lost. If the **peripheral** has no data to transmit for a prolonged period exceeding the supervision timeout, the connection may be terminated by either the **peripheral** or the **central** device.
    

### üîÉ **Data Exchange**

This is the phase where the devices assume **client** and **server** roles. The meaning of these roles is similar to the context of regular networking. A **server** is a data provider and a **client** is a data requestor. While a **central** role often aligns with a **client** role and a **peripheral** roles often aligns with a **server** role, thats not always the case. Pre-connection roles are not tied to post-connection data exchange roles. Meaning that a **peripheral** or **central** device can dynamically switch between data exchange roles, allowing a device to act either as a **client** or a **server** as needed.

In a BLE connection, all data is exchanged through **attributes**. An **attribute** itself is a data structure and is the basic building block forming larger data structures defined by the GATT layer like **services** and **characteristics** (more next). An **attribute** can simply be viewed as a shared variable between two devices that both can modify. Why is this necessary? one might wonder. Meaning that, we could have exchanged data purely through attributes. Interoperability is one of the main reasons. By defining standardized **services** and **characteristics**, BLE devices from different manufacturers can communicate and interoperate seamlessly. This promotes compatibility and allows for the creation of diverse ecosystems of BLE devices and applications.

There are several GATT layer operations that can modify attributes. These operations are split into **client**\-**initiated** and **server**\-**initiated**, depending on the source triggering a data exchange operation. Here are the main GATT operations:

1. **Read**: This is a **client**\-**initiated** operation. This operation allows a **client** device to retrieve the value of a **characteristic** from a **server** device. The **client** sends a read request to the **server**, and the **server** responds with the current value of the **characteristic**.
    
2. **Write**: This is a **client**\-**initiated** operation. This operation allows a **client** device to set the value of a **characteristic** on a **server** device. The **client** sends a write request containing the new value, and the **server** updates the **characteristic** value accordingly.
    
3. **Write Without Response**: This is a **client**\-**initiated** operation. Similar to the write operation, this operation allows a **client** device to set the value of a **characteristic** on a **server** device. However, unlike the write operation, the write without response operation does not require an acknowledgment from the **server**. This can be used for faster data transmission when acknowledgment is not necessary.
    
4. **Notify**: This is a **server**\-**initiated** operation. This operation allows a **server** device to send notifications to a **client** device when the value of a **characteristic** changes. The **client** subscribes to notifications for a specific **characteristic**, and the **server** sends notifications whenever the **characteristic** value is updated.
    
5. **Indicate**: This is a **server**\-**initiated** operation. Similar to notifications, this operation allows a **server** device to send indications to a **client** device when the value of a **characteristic** changes. However, indications require acknowledgment from the **client**, ensuring reliable delivery of data.

### üõéÔ∏è **Services & Characteristics**

As mentioned earlier, the basic building block in BLE is an **attribute**. As such, both **services** and **characteristics** are special types of **attributes** reserved to provide some structure in the data exchange process.

**Services** are a type of attribute that represent a collection of related data or functionalities offered by a BLE device. Each **service** is identified by a unique 16-bit or 128-bit Universally Unique Identifier (**UUID**). **Services** typically contain one or more **characteristics** and define the capabilities of the device. **Services** act as containers for **characteristics** and provide a logical grouping for related functionality.

**Characteristics** are another type of **attribute** that represent individual data elements within a **service**. Each **characteristic** has its own unique 16-bit or 128-bit **UUID** as well within the context of its parent **service**. **Characteristics** define specific pieces of data or operations that can be performed, such as reading a sensor value or writing a configuration parameter. **Characteristics** have properties that define how they can be accessed and manipulated, such as **read**, **write**, **notify**, and **indicate** (GATT Operations).

There also exists **descriptors** which are additional **attributes** that provide metadata or additional information about a **characteristic**. **Descriptors** are optional and can be used to specify **characteristics'** properties, permissions, and user-friendly descriptions. **Descriptors** like all other **attributes** also have their own unique 16-bit or 128-bit **UUID. Descriptors** provide context and additional details about **characteristics**, enhancing their usability and interoperability.

Lets take an example. Say we want to create a BLE-enabled fitness tracker which part of it tracks the heart rate. One **service** could be a heart rate **service** that would encompass heart rate-related functionalities. This type of **service** could have several **characteristics**, one could be a heart rate measurement **characteristic** and another would be a body sensor location **characteristic**.

The BLE standard provides a lot of standard **services** for common applications to leverage in designs. However, we are not mandated to use any of them. We can actually create our own **services** and **characteristics** to exchange data which is what we'll be doing in our example. To exchange data though, a device should have at least one **service** that encompasses at least one **characteristic**.

In our example we'll be creating a **peripheral server** with one **characteristic** that can be **read** from or **written** to.

## **üë®‚Äçüíª Code Implementation**

### **üì• Crate Imports**

In this implementation, the following crates are required:

* The `esp_idf_hal` crate to import delays.
    
* The `esp_idf_sys` crate since its needed.
    
* The `esp32_nimble` crate for the BLE abstractions.
    

```rust
use esp32_nimble::{uuid128, BLEAdvertisementData, BLEDevice, NimbleProperties};
use esp_idf_hal::delay::FreeRtos;
use esp_idf_sys as _;
```

### **üéõ Initialization/Configuration Code**

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Obtain a handle for the BLE device**: Similar to the pattern we've seen in embedded Rust with peripherals, as part of the singleton design pattern, we first have to take ownership of the device peripherals. In this context, its the `BLEDevice` that we need to take ownership of. This is done using the `take()` associated method. Here I create a BLE device handler named `ble_device` as follows:

```rust
let ble_device = BLEDevice::take();
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Create an Advertiser Instance**: After initializing the NimBLE stack we create an advertiser instance by calling `get_advertising`, this will create a `&Mutex<BLEAdvertising>` instance. Heres the code:

```rust
let ble_advertiser = ble_device.get_advertising();
```

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Obtain Handle for Server**: We create a `server` instance by calling `get_server`, this will create a `BLEServer` instance. Heres the code:

```rust
let server = ble_device.get_server();
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Define Server Connect & Disconnect Behaviour:** using the `server` instance there exists a `on_connect` method for `BLEServer`. `on_connect` has one argument which is a closure that passes a handle for a `BLEServer` and a `BLEConnDesc` that contains connection information. In the closure body, upon connect, we'll print the connection data to the console then update the connection parameters. To update connection parameters, the `BLEServerupdate_conn_params` method is used and has the following signature:

```rust
pub fn update_conn_params(
    &mut self,
    conn_handle: u16,
    min_interval: u16,
    max_interval: u16,
    latency: u16,
    timeout: u16
) -> Result<(), BLEError>
```

`conn_handle` is the connection handle of the client, `min_interval` is a value for the minimum **connection interval** in ms, `max_interval` is a value for the maximum **connection interval** in ms, `latency` is expressed as the number of intervals to skip if theres no data to transmit, and `timeout` is the **supervisiontimeout** time in 10ms units. Here's the code:

```rust
server.on_connect(|server, clntdesc| {
    // Print connected client data
    println!("{:?}", clntdesc);
    // Update connection parameters
    server
        .update_conn_params(clntdesc.conn_handle(), 24, 48, 0, 60)
        .unwrap();
});
```

Similar to `on_connect` theres an `on_disconnect` method. `on_disconnect` also has one argument which is a closure that passes a handle for a `BLEConnDesc` and a `Result` that contains the reason for disconnection. All were going to do is to print a message that our device disconnected.

```rust
server.on_disconnect(|_desc, _reason| {
    println!("Disconnected, back to advertising");
});
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Define Services & Characteristics:** In this example, only one **characteristic** will be defined with a read and notify properties. However, every **characteristic** has to be associated with (listed under) a **service**. To create a service, within `BLEServer` there exists a `create_service` method that takes a single `BleUuid` argument. `BleUuid` is an enum representing a Bluetooth **UUID**. To make things easier, the nimble crate provides a `uuid128` macro to parse a 128 UUID from string literals at compile time. We only need to pass a **UUID** string literal and the macro would take care of the rest. We create a service as follows:

```rust
// Create a service with custom UUID
let my_service = server.create_service(uuid128!("9b574847-f706-436c-bed7-fc01eb0965c1"));
```

The UUID used is a custom UUID generated using an [online generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) tool. `create_service` also returns a `Arc<Mutex<BLEService>>`.

Next, we need to create a **characteristic**. This is done using the `BLEServicecreate_characteristic` method which has two arguments; `BlueUuid` and `NimbleProperties`. `NimbleProperties` is a struct containing a collection of associated constants representing the different GATT operations. These constants can be or'ed together to define the operations that can modify the **characteristic**. Our **characteristic** will support `READ` and `NOTIFY` operations. `create_characteristic` will return a `Arc<Mutex<BLECharacteristic>>`. As such, we can set a starting value for the **characteristic** that we created using the `BLECharacteristicset_value` method. `set_value` takes a single `&[u8]` parameter. Here's the code:

```rust
// Create a characteristic to associate with created service
let my_service_characteristic = my_service.lock().create_characteristic(
    uuid128!("681285a6-247f-48c6-80ad-68c3dce18585"),
    NimbleProperties::READ | NimbleProperties::NOTIFY,
);

// Set a starting value for the characteristic
my_service_characteristic.lock().set_value(b"Start Value");
```

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure Advertiser Data:** This step is similar to what was done in the [BLE Advertiser post](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/embedded-rust-bluetooth-on-esp-ble-advertiser). A small difference is that here we are also attaching the **service** to the advertisement data. This is done using the `add_service_uuid` method. Note that the UUID being advertised is the same **service** UUID created earlier.

```rust
// Configure Advertiser Data
ble_advertiser
    .lock()
    .set_data(
        BLEAdvertisementData::new()
            .name("ESP32 Server")
            .add_service_uuid(uuid128!("9b574847-f706-436c-bed7-fc01eb0965c1")),
    )
    .unwrap();
```

That's it for configuration!

### **üì± Application Code**

**Start Advertising**: Now we have to start the advertising process. This is done by calling the `BLEAdvertisingstart` method.

```rust
ble_advertiser.lock().start().unwrap();
```

**Update Characteristic**: All we have to do now is keep updating the **characteristic** by calling the `set_value` method again. Here, the `my_service_characteristic` value keeps getting updated every one every second by incrementing its contents.

```rust
let mut val = 0;

loop {
    FreeRtos::delay_ms(1000);
    my_service_characteristic.lock().set_value(&[val]).notify();
    val = val.wrapping_add(1);
}
```

## üß™ Testing

In order to test this code, you can use [nRF connect](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile) mobile app or the [bluefruit connect](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-le-connect/ios-setup) mobile app. In either app you would be able to connect to the ESP and poll the server data.

## **üì±Full Application Code**

Here is the full code for the implementation described in this post. You can additionally find the full project and others available on the [**apollolabs ESP32C3**](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/ESP32C3) git repo.

```rust
use esp32_nimble::{uuid128, BLEAdvertisementData, BLEDevice, NimbleProperties};
use esp_idf_hal::delay::FreeRtos;
use esp_idf_sys as _;

fn main() {
    esp_idf_sys::link_patches();

    // Take ownership of device
    let ble_device = BLEDevice::take();

    // Obtain handle for peripheral advertiser
    let ble_advertiser = ble_device.get_advertising();

    // Obtain handle for server
    let server = ble_device.get_server();

    // Define server connect behaviour
    server.on_connect(|server, clntdesc| {
        // Print connected client data
        println!("{:?}", clntdesc);
        // Update connection parameters
        server
            .update_conn_params(clntdesc.conn_handle(), 24, 48, 0, 60)
            .unwrap();
    });

    // Define server disconnect behaviour
    server.on_disconnect(|_desc, _reason| {
        println!("Disconnected, back to advertising");
    });

    // Create a service with custom UUID
    let my_service = server.create_service(uuid128!("9b574847-f706-436c-bed7-fc01eb0965c1"));

    // Create a characteristic to associate with created service
    let my_service_characteristic = my_service.lock().create_characteristic(
        uuid128!("681285a6-247f-48c6-80ad-68c3dce18585"),
        NimbleProperties::READ | NimbleProperties::NOTIFY,
    );

    // Modify characteristic value

    ble_advertiser
        .lock()
        .set_data(
            BLEAdvertisementData::new()
                .name("ESP32 Server")
                .add_service_uuid(uuid128!("9b574847-f706-436c-bed7-fc01eb0965c1")),
        )
        .unwrap();

    // Start Advertising
    ble_advertiser.lock().start().unwrap();

    // (Optional) Print dump of local GATT table
    // server.ble_gatts_show_local();
    
    // Init a value to pass to characteristic
    let mut val = 0;

    loop {
        FreeRtos::delay_ms(1000);
        my_service_characteristic.lock().set_value(&[val]).notify();
        val = val.wrapping_add(1);
    }
}
```

## **Conclusion**

This post introduced how to create a BLE server on the ESP32-C3 with Rust. This was by using the `esp32-nimble` crate in a standard library development environment using the `esp-idf-hal` . In this post, the ESP32-C3 was configured as a peripheral device advertising a service. The device also assumes a server role after a connection is established. Have any questions?
