## Introduction

In this post, I will enhance the GPIO button-controlled blinking project in my [previous post](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/esp32-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-gpio-button-controlled-blinking) by using a timer/counter peripheral instead. In the previous post, the focus was on the GPIO peripheral and I controlled the rate of flashing of an LED connected to a GPIO output using a button connected to a GPIO input. Even delay was created algorithmically, meaning that there was a piece of code (loop) that generated the needed delay. It was mentioned as well that using software is not ideal to create delays as it does not scale and hardware methods (ex. timer peripheral) are more appropriate. In this post, I will be enhancing the previous code by instead leveraging a timer/counter peripheral to manage the delay. This will make the delay more deterministic and scalable among different platforms. Again, I will not be using interrupts and instead would be polling a timer/counter for the elapsed time.

### **üìö** Knowledge Pre-requisites

To understand the content of this post, you need the following:

* Basic knowledge of coding in Rust.
    
* Familiarity with the basic template for creating embedded applications in Rust for the ESP32 (The [Rust on ESP Book](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/) is a good resource).
    

### **üíæ** Software Setup

All the code presented in this post is available on the [**apollolabs ESP32C3**](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/ESP32C3) git repo. Note that if the code on the git repo is slightly different then it means that it was modified to enhance the code quality or accommodate any HAL/Rust updates.

Additionally, the full project (code and simulation) is available on Wokwi [**here**](https://wokwi.com/projects/363050473642243073).

## **üë®‚Äçüé® Software Design**

The application in this post adopts the same algorithmic approach as my [previous post](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-gpio-button-controlled-blinking), however, with minor modifications. Here instead of updating a loop variable to check if it had reached the maximum value I instead poll a timer/counter and check if it reached the desired delay value. Let's incorporate these adjustments into the flow chart to see how it would look now:

![Screen Shot 2022-06-30 at 12.07.17 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656580071411/5mWZAhHmk.png align="center")

**üö® Important Notes:**

> Delay methods come in two forms, blocking and non-blocking. Blocking means that the controller will sit idle (operations blocked) until the delay finishes. Non-blocking on the other hand means allowing operations to resume and the controller can do other things meanwhile. The code will keep returning to check (poll) the timer if the delay ended. This means that for a polling approach like ours where we need to check on the button being pressed while time passes, a non-blocking approach is required. Again, if we were using interrupts this all wouldn't matter as we would have an interrupt service routine that would inform us that the button got pressed. It's worth noting that interrupts are not affected by blocking delays unless preemption is disabled.

Let's now jump into implementing this algorithm.

## **üë®‚Äçüíª Code Implementation**

### **üì• Crate Imports**

In this implementation, three crates are required as follows:

In this implementation, three crates are required as follows:

* The `esp_backtrace` crate to define the panicking behavior.
    
* The `esp32c3_hal` crate to import the ESP32C3 device hardware abstractions.
    

```rust
use esp32c3_hal::{clock::ClockControl, pac::Peripherals, prelude::*, timer::TimerGroup, Rtc, Delay, IO};
use esp_backtrace as _;
```

**üìù Notes**

> * *Each of the crate imports needs to have a corresponding dependency in the Cargo.toml file.*
>     
> * Earlier versions of the `esp32c3_hal` required the `riscv_rt` crate to be imported for startup code supporting the `#[entry]` attribute macro. Starting version `0.7.0` , an `#[entry]` attribute has been integrated into the `esp32c3_hal` . This means that an independent `riscv_rt` import is not no longer required to support the `#[entry]` attribute.

### **üéõ Peripheral Configuration Code**

Ahead of our application code, peripherals are configured through the following steps:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the device peripherals**: In embedded Rust, as part of the singleton design pattern, we first have to take the PAC level device peripherals. This is done using the `take()` method. Here I create a device peripheral handler named `dp` as follows:

```rust
let peripherals = Peripherals::take();
```

**üìù Note**

> *This is another difference you might note relative to earlier versions of the* `esp32c3_hal`. In earlier implementations `Peripherals` was imported from the `pac` module, now its imported from `peripherals` instead. While both use the `take` method, notice that in the more recent implementation, it does not return a `Result` so there's no need to `unwrap`.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Disable the Watchdogs:** Just like earlier posts, the ESP32C3 has watchdogs enabled by default and they need to be disabled. If they are not disabled then the device would keep on resetting. To avoid this issue, the following code needs to be included:

```rust
let system = peripherals.SYSTEM.split();
let clocks = ClockControl::boot_defaults(system.clock_control).freeze();
    
// Instantiate and Create Handles for the RTC and TIMG watchdog timers
let mut rtc = Rtc::new(peripherals.RTC_CNTL);
let timer_group0 = TimerGroup::new(peripherals.TIMG0, &clocks);
let mut wdt0 = timer_group0.wdt;
let timer_group1 = TimerGroup::new(peripherals.TIMG1, &clocks);
let mut wdt1 = timer_group1.wdt;
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Instantiate and Create Handle for IO**: We need to configure the LED pin as a push-pull output and obtain a handler for the pin so that we can control it. We also need to obtain a handle for the button input pin. Before we can obtain any handles for the LED and the button we need to create an `IO` struct instance. The `IO` struct instance provides a HAL-designed struct that gives us access to all gpio pins thus enabling us to create handles for individual pins. This is similar to the concept of a `split` method used in other HALs (more detail [**here**](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/demystifying-rust-embedded-hal-split-and-constrain-methods)). We do this by calling the `new()` instance method on the `IO` struct as follows:

```rust
let io = IO::new(peripherals.GPIO, peripherals.IO_MUX);
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the LED and configure it to output**: As earlier stated, the LED is connected to pin 4 (`gpio4`). As such, we need to create a handle for the LED pin that has `gpio4` configured to a push-pull output using the `into_push_pull_output()` method. We will name the handle `led` and configure it as follows:

```rust
let mut led = io.pins.gpio4.into_push_pull_output();
```

[**This**](https://docs.rs/esp32c3-hal/latest/esp32c3_hal/gpio/struct.GpioPin.html) HAL documentation page has the full list of methods that the `GpioPin` type supports.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle and configure the input button**: The push button is connected to pin 0 (`gpio0`) as stated earlier. Additionally, in the pressed state, the button pulls to ground. Also, for the button unpressed state, a pull-up resistor needs to be included so the pin goes high. An internal pull-up can be configured for the pin using the `into_pull_up_input()` method as follows:

```rust
let button = io.pins.gpio0.into_pull_up_input();
```

Note that as opposed to the LED output, the `button` handle here does not need to be mutable since we will only be reading it.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle and configure timer**: Here we need first need to obtain access to a timer peripheral to access its methods. In the ESP32 a timer exists within what is referred to as a timer group. Note that earlier when disabling the watchdogs in step 2, we actually created a handle for `timer_group0` in the statement `let timer_group0 = TimerGroup::new(peripherals.TIMG0, &clocks);` . As such, all we need to do now is to get access to `timer0` and create a handle as follows:

```rust
let mut timer0 = timer_group0.timer0;
```

This will give us access to the `timer0` methods.

This is it for configuration. Let's now jump into the application code.

### **üì±** Application Code

Following the design described earlier, I first need to initialize a delay variable `del_var` and initialize the output of the LED. `del_var` needs to be mutable as it will be modified by the delay loop. I also choose to set the initial `led` output level to low by default. Using the same `Pin` methods mentioned [earlier](https://docs.rs/stm32f4xx-hal/latest/stm32f4xx_hal/gpio/struct.Pin.html), there is a `set_low()` method that I use to achieve that.

```rust
    // Initialize LED to on or off
    led.set_low().unwrap();

    // Create and initialize a delay variable to manage delay duration
    let mut del_var = 2000_u32.millis();
```

Notice here that for `del_var` I am using a `Duration` type. `millis()` is a method that converts a number into a `Duration`.

Next inside the program loop, I first start by kicking off the counter. Examining the [timer documentation](https://docs.rs/esp32c3-hal/0.8.0/esp32c3_hal/timer/struct.Timer.html) for methods available there is a `start` method with the following signature:

```rust
fn start<Time>(&mut self, timeout: Time)
where
    Time: Into<<Timer<T> as CountDown>::Time>,
```

This method kicks off the timer to start counting for a specified `timeout` duration. The `timeout` parameter is of a generic type `Time` . In the application loop, the timer then is kicked off as follows:

```rust
timer0.start(del_var);
```

Following the kick-off of the timer, I now need to keep polling the timer for the elapsed time. As part of the `timer` available [methods](https://docs.rs/stm32f4xx-hal/latest/stm32f4xx_hal/timer/counter/struct.Counter.html), there is a `wait` method with signature:

```rust
fn wait(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error<Void>>
```

that non-blockingly ‚Äúwaits‚Äù until the countdown finishes and returns a `Result`. If the `Result` is `Ok()` then the countdown would have been completed (timer expired). This results in the following application loop:

```rust
// Application Loop
loop {
    // Start counter with with del_var duration
    timer0.start(del_var);
    // Enter loop and check for button press until counter reaches del_var
    while timer0.wait() != Ok(()) {
        if button.is_low().unwrap() {
            // If button pressed decrease the delay value by 500 ms
            del_var = del_var - 500_u32.millis();
            // If updated delay value drops below 500 ms then reset it back to starting value to 2 secs
            if del_var.to_millis() < 1000_u32 {
               del_var = 2000_u32.millis();
            }
            // Exit delay loop since button was pressed
            break;
        }
    }
    // Toggle LED
    led.toggle().unwrap();
}
```

Here you can see that I have created a `while` loop that keeps polling `timer0` until it reaches `del_var` equivalent to 2 seconds. As indicated in the design section, if the loop ends naturally then `del_var` remains unchanged. Otherwise, at any point in time while delaying, if the button is pressed I can detect it using the `is_low()` method. At which point I will be decreasing `del_var` by `500.millis()` duration. If I end up with a `del_var` value less than `500_u32` then I am restoring the original value I started with of `2001.millis()`.

**üö® Important Notes:**

> Same as the past post, once you run the code, you'll see the LED flashing but you'll notice some weird behavior. The flashing frequencies would seem to keep changing in random order. This is because of an effect called "bouncing" on the mechanical button. In Wokwi the bouncing effect can be removed as well. Check the experimentation ideas section below for more detail.

## Conclusion

In this post, an LED control application was created leveraging the GPIO and counter peripherals for the ESP32C3. All code was based on polling (without interrupts) meaning that non-blocking counters were leveraged as well. All code was created at the HAL level using the [**esp32c3-hal**](https://docs.rs/esp32c3-hal/latest/esp32c3_hal/). Have any questions? Share your thoughts in the comments below üëá.
