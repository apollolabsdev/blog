## Introduction

Hardware timers while relatively simple circuits are really effective in several applications in embedded. Timer peripherals are effective in timing both software and hardware events. Timers also have features that allow the generation of hardware waveforms (Ex. PWM). In this post, I'll use embassy to measure the width of the pulse for two different signals. The resulting pulse width value will be printed on the console.

The square waves used in this post will be generated using the Wokwi custom external block. In general, this type of measurement would be useful as it emulates the behavior of applications that include tachometers or anemometers. Tachometers and anemometers generate square wave signals that are proportional to the speed of rotation. With some calculations, and depending on the application, the provided code can be expanded to provide frequency and/or rpm values.

### **üìö** Knowledge Pre-requisites

To understand the content of this post, you need the following:

* Basic knowledge of coding in Rust.
    

### **üíæ** Software Setup

All the code presented in this post is available on the [apollolabs ESP32C3](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/ESP32C3) git repo. Note that if the code on the git repo is slightly different then it means that it was modified to enhance the code quality or accommodate any HAL/Rust updates.

Additionally, the full project (code and simulation) is available on Wokwi [here](https://wokwi.com/projects/387275512547716097).

#### **üîå** Connections

**üìù Note**

> All connection details are also shown in the [Wokwi example](https://wokwi.com/projects/387275512547716097).

Connections include the following:

* Gpio0 wired to the top pin of the breakout custom chip.
    
* Gpio1 wired to the bottom pin of the breakout custom chip.
    

## **üë®‚Äçüé®** Software Design

The square wave signal is going to be fed into the ESP32 as an input. For the purpose of this post, the code will measure the widths of the pulses in each square wave. The custom chip is designed such that one wave generates pulses that are 10ms wide and another that are 25ms wide. To measure the pulse width, the algorithm in this post needs to determine the time elapsed between every positive edge and the negative edge that follows.

Following the configuration of the pins and the device, for each pin the follow steps are taken:

1. `await` a positive edge transition.
    
2. Capture timer instant.
    
3. `await` negative edge transition.
    
4. Calculate then print the duration of the pulse.
    
5. Go back to step 1
    

Let's now jump into implementing this logic.

**üö® *Important Note***

> The custom chip block in Wokwi has its own internal code that generates the square waves/pulses. There is a tab in the project where one can look at the source code. However, how to create and code a custom block is not part of this post. For the interested in creating custom chips in Wokwi I recommend checking out the [chips api documentation](https://docs.wokwi.com/chips-api/getting-started).

## **üë®‚Äçüíª** Code Implementation

### **üì•** Crate Imports

In this implementation, the following crates are required:

* The `embassy_executor` crate to import the embassy executor.
    
* The `esp32c3-hal` crate to import the necessary ESP32C3 abstractions.
    
* The `esp_backtrace` crate needed to define panic behavior.
    
* The `embassy_time` crate to obtain timer abstractions.
    
* The `embedded_hal_async` crate to obtain digital pin `Wait` abstractions.
    
* The `esp_backtrace` crate needed to define panic behavior.
    

```rust
use embassy_executor::Spawner;
use embassy_time::Instant;
use embedded_hal_async::digital::Wait;
use esp32c3_hal::gpio::{AnyPin, Input, PullUp};
use esp32c3_hal::{clock::ClockControl, embassy, peripherals::Peripherals, prelude::*, IO};
use esp_backtrace as _;
```

### **üíì The Pulse Timer Task**

There are two pulse timer tasks, one for each pin. Both will replicate the same behavior except for two different pins. The pulse timer task is expected to `await` for pin edges to time the pulse width. These are the required steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a Pulse Timer Task**: Tasks are marked by the `#[embassy_executor::task]` macro followed by a `async` function implementation. The task created is referred to as `pulse1_timer` task defined as follows:

```rust
#[embassy_executor::task]
async fn pulse1_timer(mut pin: AnyPin<Input<PullUp>>) {
```

There is a similar task that will have the exact same code called `pulse2_timer` .

#### **üîÅ Task Loop**

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Wait for rising edge on pin:** The first thing we need to do is `await` the incoming pulse to become high. For that, there exists a `wait_for_high` method implementation for the `Wait` trait in the [`embedded-hal-async`](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-async/1.0.0-rc.2/embedded_hal_async/digital/trait.Wait.html). `wait_for_high` is an `async` function that resolves into a `Future` if its waiting on a condition. Otherwise, we get a `Result` . We call `wait_for_high` on `pin` as follows:

```rust
pin.wait_for_high().await.unwrap();
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Capture the time instant:** now that the signal turned high, a timer needs to be started to time the duration of the pulse. Using the `new` method from the `Instant` abstraction in the `embassy-time` crate allows the capture of the current time instant. We can bind the captured instant to an `inst` variable as follows:

```rust
let inst = Instant::now();
```

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Wait for falling edge on pin:** Now all we need to do is `await` the incoming signal to become low marking the end of the pulse. Now instead we use a `wait_for_low` method implementation for the `Wait` trait in the [`embedded-hal-async`](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-async/1.0.0-rc.2/embedded_hal_async/digital/trait.Wait.html). We call `wait_for_low` on `pin` as follows:

```rust
pin.wait_for_low().await.unwrap();
```

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate and print duration:** To calculate the `Duration`, `Instant` has a `checked_duration_since` method that takes two `Instant`s and calculates a `Duration`. As such, we have to calculate the difference between the current Instant (after falling edge) and `inst` that was captured after a rising edge. Also using the `as_millis` `Duration` method, we can extract the time in milliseconds and print as follows:

```rust
// Calculate Duration
let pwidth = Instant::checked_duration_since(&Instant::now(), inst).unwrap();
// Print Duration
esp_println::println!("Sq Wave 1 Pulse Width is {}ms", pwidth.as_millis());
```

### **üì± The Main Task**

The start of the main task is marked by the following code:

```rust
#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(spawner: Spawner)
```

The following steps will mark the tasks performed in the main task.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the device peripherals & system clocks**: In embedded Rust, as part of the singleton design pattern, we first have to take the device peripherals. This is done using the `take()` method. Here I create a device peripheral handler named `peripherals` , a system peripheral handler `system`, and a system clock handler `clocks` as follows:

```rust
let peripherals = Peripherals::take();
let system = peripherals.SYSTEM.split();
let clocks = ClockControl::boot_defaults(system.clock_control).freeze();
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Embassy Timers for the ESP32C3:** In embassy, there exists an `init` function that takes two parameters. The first is system clocks and the second is an instance of a timer. Under the hood, what this function does is initialize the embassy timers. As such, we can initialize the embassy timers as follows:

```rust
embassy::init(
    let timer_group0 = esp32c3_hal::timer::TimerGroup::new(peripherals.TIMG0, &clocks);
    embassy::init(&clocks, timer_group0.timer0);
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Instantiate and Create Handle for IO**: We need to configure the signal input pins as inputs and obtain handlers for them. Before we can obtain any handles we need to create an `IO` struct instance. The `IO` struct instance provides a HAL-designed struct that gives us access to all gpio pins thus enabling us to create handles for individual pins. This is similar to the concept of a `split` method used in other HALs (more detail [**here**](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/demystifying-rust-embedded-hal-split-and-constrain-methods)). We do this by calling the `new()` instance method on the `IO` struct as follows:

```rust
let io = IO::new(peripherals.GPIO, peripherals.IO_MUX);
```

Note how the `new` method requires passing the `GPIO` and `IO_MUX` peripherals.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle and configure the signal input pins**: The signal inputs are connected to pins 0 and 1 (`gpio0` and `gpio1`) as stated earlier. Additionally, since the pin is driven by an external signal that has known states it can be configured as floating. A floating input can be configured for the pin using the `into_floating_input()` method as follows:

```rust
let del_but = io.pins.gpio2.into_floating_input().degrade();
```

Note that we are using the `degrade` method which "degrades" the pin type into a generic `AnyPin` type that is required to pass to the `button_press` task.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Spawn Pulse Timer Tasks**: now that configuration is done, we can kick off both the `pulse1_timer` and `pulse2_timer` tasks. This is done using the `spawn` method as follows:

```rust
spawner.spawn(pulse1_timer(pulse1)).ok();
spawner.spawn(pulse2_timer(pulse2)).ok();
```
