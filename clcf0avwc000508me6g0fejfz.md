## Introduction

From a [past post](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-dma-controllers) about the stm32f4xx-hal, to say the least, working with DMA controllers for the first time was a royal pain. This was even when the RTIC framework was used, which in a way made things easier. As a result, I decided to set up DMA in embassy and see how it compares. The results are astonishing. Setting up DMA in embassy turns out to be incredibly simple. The main drawback though is that DMA, at the point of writing this post, is still not supported for all STM32 peripherals just yet (significantly ADCs). Though it's a matter of time.

In this post, I demonstrate DMA usage by creating a UART application that echoes messages received from a host PC. The application will use DMA channels to buffer data for both transmit and receive operations.

### üìö Knowledge Pre-requisites

To understand the content of this post, you need the following:

* Basic knowledge of coding in Rust.
    
* Knowledge of `async/await` and `Futures`.
    
* Familiarity with the basic template for creating applications in Rust embassy.
    
* Familiarity with interrupts in Cortex-M processors.
    
* Familiarity with [UART communication basics](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/uart-a-hardware-communication-protocol.html).
    

### üíæ Software Setup

All the code presented in this post in addition to instructions for the environment and toolchain setup is available on the [apollolabsdev Nucleo-F401RE](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/stm32-nucleo-f401re) git repo. Note that if the code on the git repo is slightly different then it means that it was modified to enhance the code quality or accommodate any HAL/Rust updates.

In addition to the above, you would need to install some sort of serial communication terminal on your host PC. Some recommendations include:

**For Windows**:

* [PuTTy](https://www.putty.org/)
    
* [Teraterm](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en)
    
* [Serial Studio](https://serial-studio.github.io/)
    

**For Mac and Linux**:

* [minicom](https://wiki.emacinc.com/wiki/Getting_Started_With_Minicom)
    
* [Serial Studio](https://serial-studio.github.io/)
    

Apart from Serial Studio, some detailed instructions for the different operating systems are available in the [Discovery Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit/06-serial-communication/index.html).

For me, Serial Studio comes highly recommended. I personally came across [Serial Studio](https://serial-studio.github.io/) recently and found it to be awesome for two main reasons. First is that you can skip many of those instructions for other tools, especially in Mac and Linux systems. Second, if you are you want to graph data over UART, it has a really nice and easy-to-configure setup. It's also open-source and free to use.

### üõ† Hardware Setup

#### Materials

* [Nucleo-F401RE board](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdEhurV)
    

![nucleof401re.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1659779074203/HjlMouvt1.jpg align="center")

#### üîå Connections

There will be no need for external connections. On-board connections will be utilized and include the following:

* The UART Tx and Rx lines connect to the PC through the onboard USB bridge via pins PA2 and PA3 on the microcontroller, respectively. These are hardwired pins, meaning you cannot use any other for this setup. Unless you are using a different board other than the Nucleo-F401RE, you have to check the relevant documentation (reference manual or datasheet) to determine the number of the pin.
    

## üë®‚Äçüé® Software Design

For the purposes of this post, there isn't anything too special being performed. Using `async`, the application will keep listening for a UART message to be received. Once a message is received, it will be echoed back (transmitted) to the host.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Code Implementation

üìù **Note**:

> The application here will be using `async` and thus the embassy executor. This means that the embassy template using the `#[embassy_executor::main]` macro and the `async` `main` function needs to be used.

### üì• Crate Imports

In this implementation the crates required are as follows:

* The `embassy_executor` crate to import the embassy embedded async/await executor.
    
* The `embassy_stm32` crate to import the embassy STM32 series microcontroller device hardware abstractions. The needed abstractions are imported accordingly.
    
* The `panic_halt` crate to define the panicking behavior to halt on panic.
    

```rust
use embassy_executor::Spawner;
use embassy_stm32::interrupt;
use embassy_stm32::usart::{Config, Uart};
use panic_halt as _;
```

### üì± The Main Task

#### üéõ Peripheral Configuration & Task Spawning

The start of the main task is marked by the following code:

```rust
#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(spawner: Spawner)
```

The main task in this application will be the only one we have and the only one we need. The following steps will mark the tasks performed in the main task:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Initialize MCU and obtain a handle for the device peripherals**: A device peripheral handler `p` is created:

```rust
 let p = embassy_stm32::init(Default::default());
```

Here we're just passing the default value for the `Config` type.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure UART and obtain handle**: Looking into the Nucleo-F401RE board pinout, the Rx and Tx line pins PA3 and PA2, respectively, connect to the USART2 peripheral in the microcontroller device. As such, this means we need to configure USART2 and somehow pass it to the handle of the pins we want to use. Under `embassy_stm32::usart::Uart` there exists a `new` method to configure UART with the following signature:

```rust
pub fn new(
    peri: impl Peripheral<P = T> + 'd,
    rx: impl Peripheral<P = impl RxPin<T>> + 'd,
    tx: impl Peripheral<P = impl TxPin<T>> + 'd,
    irq: impl Peripheral<P = T::Interrupt> + 'd,
    tx_dma: impl Peripheral<P = TxDma> + 'd,
    rx_dma: impl Peripheral<P = RxDma> + 'd,
    config: Config,
) -> Self {
```

Where `peri` expects an argument passing in a UART peripheral instance, `rx` and `tx` `Pin` instances for the UART Rx and Tx pins, `irq` a handle for the UART interrupt source, `rx_dma` `tx_dma` instances for DMA channels, and `config` a `Config` configuration struct to configure UART. As such, a handle `irq` for the interrupt source is created as follows:

```rust
let irq = interrupt::take!(USART2);
```

And then the UART peripheral instance `usart` created in the following line of code:

```rust
    let mut usart = Uart::new(
        p.USART2,
        p.PA3,
        p.PA2,
        irq,
        p.DMA1_CH6,
        p.DMA1_CH5,
        Config::default(),
    );
```

Here `USART2` is passed since it corresponds in the STM32F401 to pins `PA2` and `PA3` which are also passed as second and third parameters. The choice of the DMA channels `DMA1_CH5` and `DMA1_CH6`, are not random and are obtained from the datasheet of the STM32F401.

That's it, UART is configured with two DMA channels for receiving and transmitting!

#### üîÅ The Application

The application code is only 4 lines long:

```rust
let mut msg: [u8; 8] = [0; 8];    

usart.write(b"Starting Echo\r\n").await.unwrap();

loop {
   usart.read(&mut msg).await.unwrap();
   usart.write(&msg).await.unwrap();
 }
```

After printing the "Starting Echo" message, the application enters the continuous loop. In the loop, the `usart.read(&mut msg).await.unwrap();` line will `await` until it reads enough characters to fill `msg`. After that, the `usart.write(&msg).await.unwrap();` line echoes back all the characters in `msg`.

That's it! This concludes the code for the full application.

## üì± Full Application Code

Here is the full code for the implementation described in this post. You can additionally find the full project and others available on the [apollolabsdev git repo](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/stm32-nucleo-f401re).

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]
#![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)]

use embassy_executor::Spawner;
use embassy_stm32::interrupt;
use embassy_stm32::usart::{Config, Uart};
use panic_halt as _;

#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(_spawner: Spawner) {
    let p = embassy_stm32::init(Default::default());

    let irq = interrupt::take!(USART2);
    let mut usart = Uart::new(
        p.USART2,
        p.PA3,
        p.PA2,
        irq,
        p.DMA1_CH6,
        p.DMA1_CH5,
        Config::default(),
    );

    usart.write(b"Starting Echo\r\n").await.unwrap();

    let mut msg: [u8; 8] = [0; 8];

    loop {
        usart.read(&mut msg).await.unwrap();
        usart.write(&msg).await.unwrap();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this post, a UART-based application using DMA channels was created using Rust on the Nucleo-F401RE development board. All code was created leveraging the embassy framework for STM32. It shows how attaching and configuring DMA channels in embassy is quite simple compared to other Rust HALs. Have any questions/comments? Share your thoughts in the comments below üëá.
