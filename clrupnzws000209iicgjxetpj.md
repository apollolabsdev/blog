## Introduction

I2C is a popular serial communication protocol in embedded systems. Another common name used is also Two-Wire Interface (TWI), since, well, it is. I2C is commonly found in sensors and interface boards as it offers a compact implementation with decent speeds reaching Mbps. Counter to UART, I2C allows multiple devices (up to 127) to tap into the same bus. As a result, it becomes often useful if there is a way to scan for devices that are connected.

In this post, I will be configuring and setting up I2C communication for the ESP32C3 to scan the bus for devices. The code would detect if there is a device connected to a particular address. The retrieved results will also be printed on the console.

### üìö Knowledge Pre-requisites

To understand the content of this post, you need the following:

* Basic knowledge of coding in Rust.
    
* Familiarity with the basic template for creating embedded applications in Rust.
    
* Familiarity with [**I2C communication basics**](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c/all).
    

### üíæ Software Setup

All the code presented in this post is available on the [**apollolabs ESP32C3**](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/ESP32C3) git repo. Note that if the code on the git repo is slightly different then it means that it was modified to enhance the code quality or accommodate any HAL/Rust updates.

Additionally, the full project (code and simulation) is available on Wokwi [**here**](https://wokwi.com/projects/387823866026280961).

#### üîå Connections

* Gpio3 wired to the SDA pin of all I2C devices.
    
* Power and Gnd wired to all I2C devices on the bus.
    

## üë®‚Äçüé® Software Design

I2C communication involves a master device initiating communication with a slave device through a start condition, followed by sending the slave's address and a read/write bit. The slave responds with an acknowledgment, and data transfer occurs with subsequent acknowledgment or non-acknowledgment after each byte. Finally, the communication is concluded with a stop condition. Furthermore, the address field of an I2C frame is 7-bits wide which supports up to 127 devices on a connected single bus.

Note how after a slave address is sent, a slave device has to respond with an acknowledgment. If a slave does not respond, it means that it does not exist on the bus. As such, to create an I2C scanner the following steps need to be taken:

1. Initialize `address` to 0.
    
2. Send a read frame to `address`
    
3. If ack received, record that device detected at `address` , otherwise, record that no device is connected.
    
4. Increment `address` .
    
5. If `address`&lt; 127 Go back to step 2. Otherwise, terminate the application.
    

## üë®‚Äçüíª Code Implementation

### üì• Crate Imports

In this implementation the crates required are as follows:

* The `esp32c3_hal` crate to import the ESP32C3 device hardware abstractions.
    
* The `esp_backtrace` crate to define the panicking behavior.
    
* The `esp_println` crate to provide `println!` implementation.
    

```rust
use esp32c3_hal::{clock::ClockControl, 
    i2c::I2C, 
    peripherals::Peripherals, 
    prelude::*, 
    IO,
};
use esp_backtrace as _;
use esp_println::println;
```

### üéõ Peripheral Configuration Code

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the device peripherals**: In embedded Rust, as part of the singleton design pattern, we first have to take the PAC-level device peripherals. This is done using the `take()` method. Here I create a device peripheral handler named `dp` as follows:

```rust
let peripherals = Peripherals::take();
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Instantiate and obtain handle to system clocks:** The system clocks need to be configured as they are needed in setting up the `I2C` peripheral. To set up the system clocks we need to first make the `SYSTEM` struct compatible with the HAL using the `split` method (more insight on this [here](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/demystifying-rust-embedded-hal-split-and-constrain-methods)). After that, the system clock control information is passed to `boot_defaults` in `ClockControl`. `ClockControl` controls the enablement of peripheral clocks providing necessary methods to enable and reset specific peripherals. Finally, the `freeze()` method is applied to freeze the clock configuration. Note that freezing the clocks is a protection mechanism by the HAL to avoid the clock configuration changing during runtime.

```rust
    let system = peripherals.SYSTEM.split();
    let clocks = ClockControl::boot_defaults(system.clock_control).freeze();
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Instantiate and Create Handle for IO**: When creating an instance for I2C, we'll be required to pass it instances of the SDA and SCL pins. As such, we'll need to create an `IO` struct instance. The `IO` struct instance provides a HAL-designed struct that gives us access to all gpio pins thus enabling us to create handles/instances for individual pins. We do this like prior posts, by calling the `new()` instance method on the `IO` struct as follows:

```rust
let io = IO::new(peripherals.GPIO, peripherals.IO_MUX);
```

Note how the `new` method requires passing two parameters; the `GPIO` and `IO_MUX` peripherals.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure and Obtain Handle for the I2C peripheral**: To create an instance of an I2C peripheral we need to use the `new` instance method in `i2c::I2c` in the esp32c3-hal:

```rust
pub fn new<SDA, SCL>(
    i2c: impl Peripheral<P = T> + 'd,
    sda: impl Peripheral<P = SDA> + 'd,
    scl: impl Peripheral<P = SCL> + 'd,
    frequency: Rate<u32, 1, 1>,
    clocks: &Clocks<'_>
) -> I2C<'d, T>
where
    SDA: OutputPin + InputPin,
    SCL: OutputPin + InputPin,
```

The `i2c` parameter expects and instance of an i2c peripheral, the `sda` and `scl` parameters expect instances of pins configured as input/output, `frequency` is the desired bus frequency, and `clocks` is an instance of the system clocks. As such, I create an instance for the `pulse` handle as follows:

```rust
let mut i2c0 = I2C::new(
    peripherals.I2C0,
    io.pins.gpio3,
    io.pins.gpio2,
    100u32.kHz(),
    &clocks,
);
```

I've chosen `I2C0` wth `gpio3` for SDA, `gpio2` for SCL, and 100kHz for the bus frequency.

Off to the application!

### üì± Application Code

In the application, we are going to run a scan once for all possible addresses from 1 to 127. As such, a `for` loop can be utilized. In each iteration, we're first going to print the address being scanned followed by doing a `i2c` `read`. The `I2C` `read` method takes two parameters, a `u8` address and a `&[u8]` buffer to store the read data. Also, in our case, we don't really care about any data received.

`read` returns a `Result`, in which case, if the `Result` is `Ok` that means that a device was found. Otherwise, if the `Result` is `Err`, it means that an ACK was not received and a device was not found. The following is the application code:

```rust
// Start Scan at Address 1 going up to 127
for addr in 1..=127 {
    println!("Scanning Address {}", addr as u8);

    // Scan Address
    let res = i2c0.read(addr as u8, &mut [0]);

    // Check and Print Result
    match res {
        Ok(_) => println!("Device Found at Address {}", addr as u8),
        Err(_) => println!("No Device Found"),
    }
}
```

Finally, since the `main` returns a `!`, then an empty `loop` is required.

```rust
loop{}
```

        &clocks,
    );

    // This line is for Wokwi only so that the console output is formatted correctly
    esp_println::print!("\x1b[20h");

    // Start Scan at Address 1 going up to 127
    for addr in 1..=127 {
        println!("Scanning Address {}", addr as u8);

        // Scan Address
        let res = i2c0.read(addr as u8, &mut [0]);

        // Check and Print Result
        match res {
            Ok(_) => println!("Device Found at Address {}", addr as u8),
            Err(_) => println!("No Device Found"),
        }
    }

    // Loop Forever
    loop {}
}
```
