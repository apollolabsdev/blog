## Introduction

MQTT, or Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, is a lightweight and efficient communication protocol designed for the Internet of Things (IoT) and other resource-constrained networks. Developed by IBM in the late 1990s, MQTT has since gained widespread adoption due to its simplicity, low overhead, and versatility in facilitating real-time communication between devices. The motivation behind MQTT stems from the need for a reliable and scalable messaging protocol that accommodates the constraints of IoT devices, such as limited processing power, bandwidth, and intermittent connectivity. In this post, we're going to look at how to configure an ESP using Rust to subscribe to an MQTT broker.

## **üë®‚Äçüé® Software Design**

At its core, MQTT works like a chat system for devices or clients. Imagine you have two devices that want to exchange messages. One device, called the "publisher," sends messages, and the other device, called the "subscriber," receives those messages. In the MQTT world, these could be devices like sensors, thermostats, or any IoT device.

MQTT is composed of the following components:

1. **Publisher:** This is a device that has information to share. It sends a message to a central hub, called the "broker."
    
2. **Broker:** Think of the broker as a mailman. It receives messages from publishers and then delivers them to devices interested in receiving those messages. The broker keeps track of who wants what.
    
3. **Subscriber:** This is a device that has told the broker it wants to receive specific types of messages. The subscriber gets the messages from the broker when they're available.
    
4. **Topics:** Messages are categorized into topics. It's like labeling your mail. Subscribers express interest in specific topics, and the broker ensures they get the right messages.
    

For example, let's say you have a temperature sensor (publisher) in your room. It sends the current temperature to the broker with a topic like "home/room1/temperature." Your smart thermostat (subscriber) has told the broker it wants messages about "home/room1/temperature," so the broker delivers the temperature updates to the thermostat. This way, devices can talk to each other without directly knowing who or where the other is, thanks to the broker managing the communication. It's a simple, efficient, and organized way for devices to share information in the Internet of Things. Note that a device/client can also act as both a subscriber and a publisher.

In this post, we are going to configure the ESP to subscribe to an MQTT broker topic. The steps include the following:

1. Configure and Connect to WiFi
    
2. Configure MQTT
    
3. Create Client Instance and Define Event Behaviour
    
4. Subscribe to Topic
    
5. Wait for Broker Events
    

## **üë®‚Äçüíª Code Implementation**

### **üì• Crate Imports**

In this implementation, the following crates are required:

* The `anyhow` crate for error handling.
    
* The `esp_idf_hal` crate to import the peripherals.
    
* The `esp_idf_svc` crate to import the device services (wifi in particular).
    
* The `embedded_svc` crate to import the needed `wifi` and `mqtt::client service` traits.
    
* The `std::thread` and `std::time` for sleep behavior and time measurement.
    

```rust
use anyhow;
use embedded_svc::mqtt::client::Event;
use embedded_svc::mqtt::client::QoS;
use embedded_svc::wifi::{AuthMethod, ClientConfiguration, Configuration};
use esp_idf_hal::peripherals::Peripherals;
use esp_idf_svc::eventloop::EspSystemEventLoop;
use esp_idf_svc::mqtt::client::{EspMqttClient, MqttClientConfiguration};
use esp_idf_svc::nvs::EspDefaultNvsPartition;
use esp_idf_svc::wifi::{BlockingWifi, EspWifi};
use std::{thread::sleep, time::Duration};
```

### **üéõ Initialization/Configuration Code**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the device peripherals**: Similar to all past blog posts, in embedded Rust, as part of the singleton design pattern, we first have to take the device peripherals. This is done using the `take()` method. Here I create a device peripheral handler named `peripherals` as follows:

```rust
let peripherals = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure and Connect to WiFi**: this involves the same steps that were done in the [wifi post](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/edge-iot-with-rust-on-esp-connecting-wifi).

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Create the MQTT Configuration Handle:** Within `esp_idf_svc::mqtt::Client` there exists an `MqttClientConfiguration` abstraction. This is the abstraction needed to configure MQTT. `MqttClientConfiguration` contains a `default` method allowing us to configure MQTT with a `default` configuration. Following that we create an `mqtt_config` handle as follows:

```rust
let mqtt_config = MqttClientConfiguration::default();
```

Note that if you were to use MQTT with more advanced configuration, then this is the abstraction you need to update. This includes things like adding certificates for secure connections, defining client ids, hostnames, and passwords among other things. Refer to the [documentation](https://esp-rs.github.io/esp-idf-svc/esp_idf_svc/mqtt/client/struct.MqttClientConfiguration.html) for the full list of members.

That's it for Configuration!

### **üì± Application Code**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create Client Instance and Define Even Behaviour:** Within the `EspMqttClient` abstraction, there is a `new` method that is used to create an instance of `EspMqttClient`. `new` has the following signature:

```rust
pub fn new(
    url: &str,
    conf: &MqttClientConfiguration<'_>,
    callback: impl for<'b> FnMut(&'b Result<Event<EspMqttMessage<'b>>, EspError>) + Send + 'a
) -> Result<Self, EspError>
```

Note there are three parameters a `url`, a `MqttClientConfiguration` configuration, and a `callback`. The `url` as would be expected is the `url` of the broker and `conf` is the configuration we created earlier. `callback` is a closure where we would need to define `Event` behavior. Meaning, every time there is a broker `Event`, we need to know what it is and react accordingly. `Event` is an enum with the following signature:

```rust
pub enum Event<M> {
    BeforeConnect,
    Connected(bool),
    Disconnected,
    Subscribed(MessageId),
    Unsubscribed(MessageId),
    Published(MessageId),
    Received(M),
    Deleted(MessageId),
}
```

We're not going to react to all of the events but rather only the ones we care about. Those would be `Connected` that conveys that we are connected to a broker, `Suscribed` which means we are successfully subscribed to a topic, and `Recieved` that conveys we received a message from the broker. Other than that, we can simply print the message event.

For this application, we are going to use the [HiveMQ broker service](https://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/). The service broker `url` is `mqtt://broker.mqttdashboard.com` . Before running this code, you would need to go to the [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/) page and click connect. While connected, on the same page, you can define a topic to publish and a message then click publish. This would publish the message for any subscriber to read.

Following all of the above, a `client` handle is created as follows:

```rust
let mut client = EspMqttClient::new(
    "mqtt://broker.mqttdashboard.com",
    &mqtt_config,
    move |message_event| {
        match message_event.as_ref().unwrap() {
            Event::Connected(state) => println!("Connected"),
            Event::Subscribed(id) => println!("Subscribed to {} id", id),
            Event::Received(msg) => {
                if msg.data() != [] {
                    println!("Recieved {}", std::str::from_utf8(msg.data()).unwrap())
                }
            }
            _ => println!("{:?}", message_event.as_ref().unwrap()),
        };
    },
)?;
```

Note how the match statement matches what we mentioned earlier. The only additional thing to mention here is how we are handling the received message. `Recieve` wraps a `EspMqttMessage` type. `EspMqttMessage` has [several methods](https://esp-rs.github.io/esp-idf-svc/esp_idf_svc/mqtt/client/struct.EspMqttMessage.html) to process the incoming message. One of the methods is `data` that recovers the received data in a `&[u8]` . To print it out the received message it needs to be converted to a string using `std::str::from_utf8`.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Subscribe to Topic:** While we've defined the event behavior, we haven't subscribed to a topic yet. For that, we need to call the `subscribe` method on `client` that is of type `EspMqttClient` . Here's the code:

```rust
client.subscribe("testtopic/1", QoS::AtLeastOnce)?;
```

`testtopic/1` is the default topic on [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/). If you modify the topic there then you need to update it here.

When running the code, don't forget to connect the broker and then hit publish to see messages received by the ESP.

        println!("Waiting for station {:?}", config);
    }

    println!("Wifi Connected");

    // Create Client Instance and Define Behaviour on Event
    let mut client = EspMqttClient::new(
        "mqtt://broker.mqttdashboard.com",
        &mqtt_config,
        move |message_event| {

                        println!("Recieved {}", std::str::from_utf8(msg.data()).unwrap())
                    }
                }
                _ => println!("{:?}", message_event.as_ref().unwrap()),
            };
        },
    )?;

    // Subscribe to MQTT Topic
    client.subscribe("testtopic/1", QoS::AtLeastOnce)?;

    loop {
        // Keep waking up device to avoid watchdog reset
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));
    }
}
```
