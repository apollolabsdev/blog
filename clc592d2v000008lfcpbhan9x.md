## Introduction

In this post, I will be using the stm32 embassy hal to configure and set up timer and GPIO peripherals with an ultrasonic sensor to measure obstacle distance. A distance measurement will be continuously collected and sent to a PC terminal over UART. Additionally, I will not be using any interrupts and the example will be set up as a simplex system that transmits in one direction only (towards the PC). This example is an embassy rewrite of the example previously written with the stm32f4xx-hal in [this](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-timer-ultrasonic-distance-measurement) post. This post is mostly self-contained so there is no need to refer back to the older post unless one would like to compare.

### **üìö** Knowledge Pre-requisites

To understand the content of this post, you need the following:

* Basic knowledge of coding in Rust.
    
* Familiarity with the basic template for creating embedded applications in Rust.
    
* Familiarity with [UART communication basics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter).
    
* Familiarity with working principles of Ultrasonic sensors. [This](https://www.microcontrollertips.com/principle-applications-limitations-ultrasonic-sensors-faq/) page is a good resource.
    

### **üíæ** Software Setup

All the code presented in this post in addition to instructions for the environment and toolchain setup is available on the [apollolabsdev Nucleo-F401RE](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/stm32-nucleo-f401re) git repo. Note that if the code on the git repo is slightly different then it means that it was modified to enhance the code quality or accommodate any HAL/Rust updates.

In addition to the above, you would need to install some sort of serial communication terminal on your host PC. Some recommendations include:

**For Windows**:

* [**PuTTy**](https://www.putty.org/)
    
* [**Teraterm**](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en)
    
* [**Serial Studio**](https://serial-studio.github.io/)
    

**For Mac and Linux**:

* [**minicom**](https://wiki.emacinc.com/wiki/Getting_Started_With_Minicom)
    
* [**Serial Studio**](https://serial-studio.github.io/)
    

Apart from Serial Studio, some detailed instructions for the different operating systems are available in the [**Discovery Book**](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit/06-serial-communication/index.html).

For me, Serial Studio comes highly recommended. I personally came across [**Serial Studio**](https://serial-studio.github.io/) recently and found it to be awesome for two main reasons. First is that you can skip many of those instructions for other tools, especially in Mac and Linux systems. Second, if you are you want to graph data over UART, it has a really nice and easy-to-configure setup. It's also open-source and free to use.

**üö® Important Note:**

> I used the Grove modular system for connection ease. It is a more elegant approach and less prone to mistakes. One can directly wire the ultrasonic sensor to the board if need be.

#### **üîå** Connections

* Ultrasonic echo pin connected to pin PA8 (Grove Connector D7).
    
* The UART Tx line that connects to the PC through the onboard USB bridge is via pin PA2 on the microcontroller. This is a hardwired pin, meaning you cannot use any other for this setup. Unless you are using a different board other than the Nucleo-F401RE, you have to check the relevant documentation (reference manual or datasheet) to determine the number of the pin.
    

## **üë®‚Äçüé®** Software Design

The ultrasonic sensor used is a single-pin interface sensor. The single pin, referred to as the echo pin, operates in a bidirectional mode. The echo pin, first operating as an input, should be triggered by a pulse that is at least 10us wide. This would cause the sensor to emit a series of ultrasonic pulses and measure their propagation delay. After that, the echo pin switches to an output providing a pulse width proportional to the distance of the obstacle.

![Ultrasonic Pulse](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657901598049/axfh0Ir4B.png align="center")

The obstacle distance is calculated as:

$$\text{distance}{(cm)}=\frac{\text{echo pulse width}{(us)}}{29*2}$$

After the above definition, defining the algorithm becomes direct. As such, after configuring the device, the algorithmic steps are as follows:

1. Set PA8 pin output to low for 5 us to get a clean low pulse
    
2. Set PA8 pin output to high (trigger) for 10us
    
3. Switch PA8 to an input
    
4. Keep polling PA8 input until it goes high
    
5. Once the PA8 input goes high kick-off counter/timer
    
6. Keep polling PA8 input until it goes low
    
7. Obtain pulse duration measurement from counter/timer
    
8. Calculate the distance and send the result to the UART serial channel
    
9. Go back to 1
    

## üë®‚Äçüíª Code Implementation

### üì• Crate Imports

In this implementation, the following crates are required:

* The `cortex_m_rt` crate for startup code and minimal runtime for Cortex-M microcontrollers.
    
* The `cortex_m` crate to import Cortex-M microcontroller abstractions. These will be needed for using blocking delay.
    
* The `core::fmt` crate will allow us to use the `writeln!` macro for easy printing.
    
* The `heapless` crate to import and create a fixed capacity `String`.
    
* The `embassy_time` crate to import timekeeping capabilities.
    
* The `embassy_stm32` crate to import the embassy STM32 series microcontroller device hardware abstractions. The needed abstractions are imported accordingly.
    
* The `panic_halt` crate to define the panicking behavior to halt on panic.
    

```rust
use core::fmt::Write;
use cortex_m::prelude::_embedded_hal_blocking_delay_DelayUs;
use heapless::String;

use cortex_m_rt::entry;
use embassy_stm32::dma::NoDma;
use embassy_stm32::gpio::{Flex, Pull, Speed};
use embassy_stm32::usart::{Config, UartTx};
use embassy_time::{Delay, Instant};
use panic_halt as _;
```

### üéõ Peripheral Configuration Code

**Initialize MCU and obtain a handle for the device peripherals**: Ahead of configuring any peripheral a device peripheral handler `p` needs to be created:

```rust
let p = embassy_stm32::init(Default::default());
```

#### GPIO Peripheral Configuration

**Configure and Obtain Handle for GPIO Ultrasonic Echo Pin**: I need to configure the echo pin as input in the beginning and obtain a handler for the pin so that I can control it. Since I'm going to be switching the pin back and forth from input to output, I cannot use the existing `Input` and `Output` types. Instead in the [API reference](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-stm32/git/stm32f303vb/gpio/struct.Flex.html), there is a `Flex` type that is defined as a GPIO flexible pin. A `Flex` pin can dynamically be switched between input and output modes. To create an instance of PA8 that will be connected to the ultrasonic sensor, a `echo` handle is created using the `new` method in `Flex` as follows:

```rust
let mut echo = Flex::new(p.PA8);
```

#### UART Peripheral Configuration

**Obtain Handle and Configure UART peripheral**: UART is configured similar to the [embassy UART post](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/embedded-rust-embassy-uart-serial-communication) such that it can send data in a single direction to a host PC. A handle `usart` is created as follows:

```rust
let mut usart = UartTx::new(p.USART2, p.PA2, NoDma, Config::default());
```

Additional to the `usart` handle, an empty `String` handle `msg` is instantiated to later store the contents sent over UART:

```rust
let mut msg: String<64> = String::new();
```

#### Timer and Delay Peripheral Configuration:

**Obtain handle for blocking delay:** In the algorithm, there is a step where I have to provide a pulse trigger that is 10us wide. For that, I would need to use some delay method to keep the echo pin high for that duration. This can be handled by creating a blocking delay handle `delay` as follows:

```rust
let mut delay = Delay;
```

This is it for configuration! Let's now jump into the application code.

### üì± Application Code

Following the design described earlier, I first need to set the `echo` pin output to low for 5 us to get a clean low pulse. However, according to the documentation, the `echo` pin initial output level is unspecified since its instantiated as a `Flex`. As a result, the mode of the pin needs to be defined before it is used. In the `Flex` [API reference](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-stm32/git/stm32f303vb/gpio/struct.Flex.html) there is a `set_as_output` method that will configure the pin as an output. The `set_as_output` method only requires that the `Speed` of the pin is passed as an argument:

```rust
echo.set_as_output(Speed::Low);
```

After that, the pin output needs to be set to low for 5 us:

```rust
echo.set_low();
delay.delay_us(5_u32);
```

Step 2 in the algorithm requires that I set the `echo` pin output to high (trigger) for 10us:

```rust
echo.set_high();
delay.delay_us(10_u32);
```

Step 3 in the algorithm requires that I set the `echo` pin back to an input. This can be done exactly in the same manner as earlier, however using the `set_as_input` method. Compare to the `set_as_ouput` method, `set_as_input` requires instead that the `Pull` of the pin is passed as an argument:

```rust
echo.set_as_input(Pull::None);
```

Next I need to keep polling the `echo` pin until it goes high marking the start of the echo pulse. This is done as follows:

```rust
while !(echo.is_high()) {}
```

Using the `while` loop and the `is_high` `Flex` method, the code is going around this same line until the `echo` pin input goes high.

Afterward, a timer needs to be kicked off to measure the pulse width. From the `embassy_time` crate, an `Instant` type can be used to determine a `Duration`. In order to do that, two `Instant`s need to be collected to calculate a duration. As such, to kick off a measurement, a current `Instant` needs to be captured. This is done using the `now` instance method. As a result, I create an `inst` handle to capture the starting `Instant` for the measurement as follows:

```rust
let inst = Instant::now();
```

After that, I wait until the `echo` pin goes low:

```rust
while !(echo.is_low()) {}
```

Once the `echo` goes low, the current `Instant` needs to be collected and the `Duration` calculated. The [API reference](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-time/git/default/struct.Instant.html) provides a `checked_duration_since` instance method that takes a reference to the current `Instance` and a prior `Instance` (`inst` in our case) as arguments and returns a `Duration` wrapped in an `Option`. The duration is captured in a `duration` variable as follows:

```rust
let duration = Instant::checked_duration_since(&Instant::now(), inst).unwrap();
```

Since the `Duration` is wrapped in an `Option` then it needs to be `unwrap` ped to recover the value. Now that the pulse duration is available, a distance can be calculated. Using the earlier presented formula, the distance in centimeters is calculated using the following code:

```rust
let distance_cm = duration.as_micros() / 2 / 29;
```

`as_micros` is a `Duration` method provided in the [API reference](https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-time/git/default/struct.Duration.html) that converts the `Duration` to an integer number of microseconds.

Finally, the result is sent over UART using the `writeln!` macro and the `USART` `blocking_write` method:

```rust
core::writeln!(&mut msg, "Distance {:02} cm\r", distance_cm).unwrap();
usart.blocking_write(msg.as_bytes()).unwrap();
msg.clear();
```

If you have noticed, `writeln!` takes three parameters where the third parameter contains the `distance_cm` variable that was created earlier to store the result of the distance calculation.

        // Kick off timer measurement by capturing current instant
        let inst = Instant::now();

        // Wait until pin goes low.
        while !(echo.is_low()) {}

        // Stop timer and collect elapsed time
        let duration = Instant::checked_duration_since(&Instant::now(), inst).unwrap();

        // Calculate the distance in cms using formula in datasheet
        let distance_cm = duration.as_micros() / 2 / 29;

        // Send calculated distance to serial interface
        core::writeln!(&mut msg, "Distance {:02} cm\r", distance_cm).unwrap();
        usart.blocking_write(msg.as_bytes()).unwrap();
        msg.clear();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this post, an ultrasonic distance measurement application was created leveraging the GPIO and Counter peripherals for the STM32F401RE microcontroller on the Nucleo-F401RE development board. The resulting measurement is also sent over to a host PC over a UART connection. All code was based on polling (without interrupts). Additionally, all code was created at the HAL level using the STM32 Embassy HAL. Have any questions? Share your thoughts in the comments below üëá.
