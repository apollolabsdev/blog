## Introduction

Setting up UART serial communication is useful for any type of device-to-device (point-to-point) communication. One of the common past use cases for UART was in development to print output to a PC. However, for that particular use case, nowadays some microcontrollers have advanced debug features like instruction trace macrocell (aka ITM) that don't leverage the device's own peripheral resources. Obviously, this does not make UART obsolete, as it has other use cases and some controllers don't support advanced debug to start with. In this post, I will be configuring and setting up UART communication with a PC terminal for the ESP32C3. I will be leveraging the [GPIO button-controlled blinking project](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/esp32-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-gpio-button-controlled-blinking) from a previous post to print to the console how many times the button has been pressed. Additionally, I will not be using interrupts and the example will be set up as a simplex system that transmits in one direction only (towards the PC).

### **üìö** Knowledge Pre-requisites

To understand the content of this post, you need the following:

* Basic knowledge of coding in Rust.
    
* Familiarity with the basic template for creating embedded applications in Rust.
    
* Familiarity with [**UART communication basics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter).
    

### **üíæ** Software Setup

All the code presented in this post is available on the [apollolabs ESP32C3](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/ESP32C3) git repo. Note that if the code on the git repo is slightly different then it means that it was modified to enhance the code quality or accommodate any HAL/Rust updates.

Additionally, the full project (code and simulation) is available on Wokwi [here](https://wokwi.com/projects/363774125451149313).

In addition to the above, if you're using real hardware, you would need to install some sort of serial communication terminal on your host PC. Some recommendations include:

**For Windows**:

* [**PuTTy**](https://www.putty.org/)
    
* [**Teraterm**](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en)
    

**For Mac and Linux**:

* [**minicom**](https://wiki.emacinc.com/wiki/Getting_Started_With_Minicom)
    

Some installation instructions for the different operating systems are available in the [**Discovery Book**](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit/06-serial-communication/index.html).

If you are using Wokwi, then the serial terminal is integrated in the simulation window.

#### **üîå** Connections

**üìù Note**

> All connection details are also shown in the [Wokwi example](https://wokwi.com/projects/363774125451149313).

Connections include the following:

* The LED anode through a resistor to pin 4 of the devkit. This pin will be used as an output. The cathode will be connected to ground.
    
* One end of a button to pin 0 of the devkit This pin will be used as an input. The other end of the switch will be connected to ground.
    

## **üë®‚Äçüé®** Software Design

The application in this post adopts the same algorithmic approach as my [**previous post**](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-gpio-button-controlled-blinking). Here, however, I will be adding two things:

1. I will be leveraging the [**debouncr**](https://docs.rs/debouncr/latest/debouncr/) crate (yes, that's how the crate name is spelled üòÄ) to eliminate the effect of button debouncing.
    
2. I will be sending/printing a value that tracks the number of times the button is pressed to the PC terminal.
    

The updated flow diagram would look as follows:

![Flow Chart](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657001444071/is1tg2bU-.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp align="left")

Let's now jump into implementing this algorithm.

## **üë®‚Äçüíª** Code Implementation

### **üì•** Crate Imports

In this implementation, three crates are required as follows:

* The `esp_backtrace` crate to define the panicking behavior.
    
* The `esp32c3_hal` crate to import the ESP32C3 device hardware abstractions.
    
* The `debouncr` crate to debounce the button press.
    
* The `core::fmt::Write` crate will allow us to use the `writeln!` macro for easy printing.
    

```rust
use esp32c3_hal::{clock::ClockControl, pac::Peripherals, prelude::*, timer::TimerGroup, Rtc, Delay, IO};
use esp_backtrace as _;
use debouncr::{debounce_3, Edge};
use core::fmt::Write;
```

**üìù Note**

> * Each of the crate imports needs to have a corresponding dependency in the Cargo.toml file.
>     
> * *Earlier versions of the* `esp32c3_hal` required the `riscv_rt` crate to be imported for startup code supporting the `#[entry]` attribute macro. Starting version `0.7.0` , an `#[entry]` attribute has been integrated into the `esp32c3_hal` . This means that an independent `riscv_rt` import is not no longer required to support the `#[entry]` attribute.

### **üéõ** Peripheral Configuration Code

Ahead of our application code, peripherals are configured through the following steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the device peripherals**: In embedded Rust, as part of the singleton design pattern, we first have to take the PAC level device peripherals. This is done using the `take()` method. Here I create a device peripheral handler named `dp` as follows:

```rust
let peripherals = Peripherals::take();
```

**üìù Note**

> *This is another difference you might note relative to earlier versions of the* `esp32c3_hal`. In earlier implementations `Peripherals` was imported from the `pac` module, now its imported from `peripherals` instead. While both use the `take` method, notice that in the more recent implementation, it does not return a `Result` so there's no need to `unwrap`.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Disable the Watchdogs:** Just like earlier posts, the ESP32C3 has watchdogs enabled by default and they need to be disabled. If they are not disabled then the device would keep on resetting. To avoid this issue, the following code needs to be included:

```rust
let system = peripherals.SYSTEM.split();
let clocks = ClockControl::boot_defaults(system.clock_control).freeze();

// Instantiate and Create Handles for the RTC and TIMG watchdog timers
let mut rtc = Rtc::new(peripherals.RTC_CNTL);
let timer_group0 = TimerGroup::new(peripherals.TIMG0, &clocks);
let mut wdt0 = timer_group0.wdt;
let timer_group1 = TimerGroup::new(peripherals.TIMG1, &clocks);
let mut wdt1 = timer_group1.wdt;
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Instantiate and Create Handle for IO**: We need to configure the LED pin as a push-pull output and obtain a handler for the pin so that we can control it. We also need to obtain a handle for the button input pin. Before we can obtain any handles for the LED and the button we need to create an `IO` struct instance. The `IO` struct instance provides a HAL-designed struct that gives us access to all gpio pins thus enabling us to create handles for individual pins. This is similar to the concept of a `split` method used in other HALs (more detail [**here**](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/demystifying-rust-embedded-hal-split-and-constrain-methods)). We do this by calling the `new()` instance method on the `IO` struct as follows:

```rust
let io = IO::new(peripherals.GPIO, peripherals.IO_MUX);
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the LED and configure it to output**: As earlier stated, the LED is connected to pin 4 (`gpio4`). As such, we need to create a handle for the LED pin that has `gpio4` configured to a push-pull output using the `into_push_pull_output()` method. We will name the handle `led` and configure it as follows:

```rust
let mut led = io.pins.gpio4.into_push_pull_output();
```

[**This**](https://docs.rs/esp32c3-hal/latest/esp32c3_hal/gpio/struct.GpioPin.html) HAL documentation page has the full list of methods that the `GpioPin` type supports.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle and configure the input button**: The push button is connected to pin 0 (`gpio0`) as stated earlier. Additionally, in the pressed state, the button pulls to ground. Also, for the button unpressed state, a pull-up resistor needs to be included so the pin goes high. An internal pull-up can be configured for the pin using the `into_pull_up_input()` method as follows:

```rust
let button = io.pins.gpio0.into_pull_up_input();
```

Note that as opposed to the LED output, the `button` handle here does not need to be mutable since we will only be reading it.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle and configure UART channel**: On the ESP32C3 there are RX and TX pins that are configured by default to connect to UART0. As such, there is no need to configure any new pins for UART operation. As a result, to instantiate UART, in the [documentation](https://docs.rs/esp32c3-hal/latest/esp32c3_hal/uart/struct.Uart.html), there exists a `new` method to instantiate a UART channel and has the following signature:

```rust
pub fn new(uart: impl Peripheral<P = T> + 'd) -> Uart<'d, T>
```

This method instantiates UART with a default configuration. The default configuration can be found in the [source code](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/blob/main/esp-hal-common/src/uart.rs) and has the following parameters:

```rust
impl Default for Config {
    fn default() -> Config {
        Config {
            baudrate: 115_200,
            data_bits: DataBits::DataBits8,
            parity: Parity::ParityNone,
            stop_bits: StopBits::STOP1,
        }
    }
}
```

Since we need to instantiate a UART instance for UART0 this will result in the following code:

```rust
let mut uart0 = Uart::new(peripherals.UART0);
```

**üö® *Important Notes:***

> * *To figure out what the default configuration* entails, I had to go into the source code and find the `Default` trait implementation. Unfortunately, the HAL documentation itself does not make it easily obvious what the default configuration is.
>     
> * If one wishes to configure UART with different parameters, there exists a `new_with_config` function that can be called instead when creating a UART instance.
>     

***üí∞ Tip:***

> In Wokwi, there is a useful approach to determine if the pins are configured correctly. After hitting the play button, hit pause while the simulation is running. The active pin functions will be printed beside each pin.

### **üì±** Application Code

Following the design described earlier, I first need to initialize a delay variable `del_var` and initialize the output of the LED. `del_var` needs to be mutable as it will be modified by the delay loop. I also choose to set the initial `led` output level to low by default. Using the same `Pin` methods mentioned earlier, there is a `set_low()` method that I use to achieve that.

```rust
// Create and initialize a delay variable to manage delay loop
let mut del_var = 10_0000_u32;

// Initialize LED to on or off
led.set_low().unwrap();
```

I also want to initialize a variable `value` that I want to use to track how many times the button has been pressed:

```rust
let mut value: u8 = 0;
```

Afterward, I have one small thing remaining. I mentioned that I will be using the `debouncr` crate to debounce button presses. This means I need to create some sort of handler to utilize the crate methods. In the crate [**documentation**](https://docs.rs/debouncr/latest/debouncr/), to instantiate, I first need to determine how many states need to be detected. I chose 16.

```rust
let mut debouncer = debounce_16(false);
```

The reason I initialized `debouncer` to `false` is that the documentation mentioned that I have to do that if the button is active low.

**üö® *Important Notes:***

> To choose the debounce states, I experimented and found that, on hardware, 3 states were sufficient to eliminate the effect. However, in Wokwi I didnt see a result consistent with hardware. Although I put in the maximum number of states allowed, the bouncing effect was reduced, though not eliminated.

Next inside the program loop, I first start by calling a delay function where inside of it I check if the button is pressed. After the delay completes, I toggle led using the toggle() method, again part of the methods available for the Pin type. This is the complete application loop:

```rust
loop {
    for _i in 1..del_var {
        if debouncer.update(button.is_low().unwrap()) == Some(Edge::Falling) {
            writeln!(tx, "Button Press {:02}\r", value).unwrap();
            value = value.wrapping_add(1);
            del_var = del_var - 2_5000_u32;
            if del_var < 2_5000_u32 {
                del_var = 10_0000_u32;
            }
            break;
        }
    }
    led.toggle();
}
```

The general structure is exactly the same as the application loop in the [regular polled button-controlled blinking application](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/esp32-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-gpio-button-controlled-blinking). The outer `for` loop is the one that keeps track of the delay through `del_var`. A difference here is the `if` statement condition. For the condition, I am leveraging the `update` method from the `debouncr` crate. When polling the pin, the `update` method is repeatedly called. The `update` method returns an `Option` enum that keeps providing a `None` when no press is detected. However, if a (debounced) press is detected, the `update` method returns either a `Some(Edge::Falling)` or `Some(Edge::Rising)`. Since the ESP32C3 has an active-low button, a press is detected with a falling edge and a `Some(Edge::Falling)` is returned on a successful debounce.

Once the button detect is completed, I use the `writeln!` macro provided by `core::fmt::Write` that I imported earlier. The usage is exactly the same as the formatted print using `println!` in Rust with a couple of small exceptions. Examining the statement,

```rust
writeln!(uart0, "Button Press {:02}\r", value).unwrap();
```

If you have noticed, `writeln!` takes three parameters and in the first parameter of `writeln!`, I am passing the `uart0` handler as an argument. For `writeln!` to work, `uart0` has to have the `write_fmt` function defined for the `Write` trait. Additionally, the `writeln!` macro needs to be unwrapped since it returns a `Result`. The third parameter of `writeln!` also contains the `value` variable initialized earlier that is being incremented by the following line as follows:

```rust
value = value.wrapping_add(1);
```

The `wrapping_add` method, as the name implies performs a wrapping add on `value` adding `1` every time the method is called and wraps around if needed. The remaining code takes care of decreasing the value of `del_var` to reduce the delay and make sure that it does not drop below zero. Finally, outside of the delay loop the led is toggled using the `Pin` `toggle` method.

***üí∞ Tip:***

> In order to do console printing using the ESP, an alternative approach is to use the [esp-println](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-println) crate. [esp-println](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-println) is more portable where it provides implmenentations of `print!`, `println!` and `dbg!` for various Espressif devices.

## **üì±** Full Application Code

## **üî¨** Further Experimentation/Ideas

* If you have access to real hardware, try configuring UART with different parameters.
    
* Implement UART with transmit and receive functionality.
    

## Conclusion

In this post, an LED control application was created leveraging the GPIO and UART peripherals for the ESP32C3. The UART peripheral sends to a host PC a status update every time a GPIO button is pressed. All code was based on polling (without interrupts). All code was created at the HAL level using the [**esp32c3-hal**](https://docs.rs/esp32c3-hal/latest/esp32c3_hal/).Have any questions? Share your thoughts in the comments below üëá
