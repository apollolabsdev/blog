## Introduction

This post is the first in a new IoT series for using Rust on the ESP32. This new series will focus on several IoT hardware and cloud connectivity aspects such as WiFi and HTTP. In a [past post](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/the-embedded-rust-esp-development-ecosystem) explaining the Rust ecosystem, such features are referred to as services in the ESP-IDF framework. Consequently, support for almost all ESP-IDF services is provided through the `esp-idf-svc` crate. These services include Wifi, Ethernet, HTTP client & server, MQTT, WS, NVS, OTA, etc.

For most of the IoT services, acquiring some sort of access to the network always comes first. As such, in this post, we'll start the series by configuring and setting up WiFi in which we'll be leveraging the `esp-idf-svc` crate for that. This post is meant to be kept simple since adding more services can drive the code toward verbosity quickly. This same code, however, will be utilized again in all following posts in this series to achieve network connection.

### **üìö Knowledge Pre-requisites**

To understand the content of this post, you need the following:

* Basic knowledge of coding in Rust.
    
* Basic familiarity with WiFi.
    

### **üíæ Software Setup**

All the code presented in this post is available on the [**apollolabs ESP32C3**](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/ESP32C3) git repo. Note that if the code on the git repo is slightly different then it means that it was modified to enhance the code quality or accommodate any HAL/Rust updates.

Additionally, the full project (code and simulation) is available on Wokwi [**here**](https://wokwi.com/projects/377102759837433857).

## **üë®‚Äçüé® Software Design**

We can configure WiFi to be in either station mode or access point mode. Access point mode is when we want to set up the ESP as a hotspot to allow other clients to connect to it. Sort of like a router that you have at home. On the other hand, station mode is the one we'll be using and more familiar with. Station mode is when you are accessing a wireless hotspot as a client. To do that we need to go through the following steps:

1. Configure WiFi
    
2. Start WiFi
    
3. Connect WiFi
    
4. (Optional) Confirm Connection and Check Connection Configuration
    

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The anyhow Crate

Before proceeding further, I'd like to mention the [`AnyHow` crate](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/). In most prior posts, you might notice that many methods, especially configuring peripherals, return a `Result`. In most cases before, I would use the `unwrap` method to obtain the wrapped values. `Result` as commonly known in Rust has two options; `Ok()` and `Err()` . `unwrap` in turn, extracts the value contained in the `Ok` variant of a `Result` . However, if the `Result` is the `Err` variant, then `unwrap` will panic with a generic message.

You can imagine that this behavior can make errors hard to debug. As a result, if the hardware can provide more context it would be helpful. The ESP-IDF framework already has a list of [error codes](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/error-codes.html) that allow for the creation of more robust applications. The different error codes give more context into the type of run-time errors and whether they are recoverable or not. Espressif integrates these error codes through the `anyhow` crate. As such, if your code panics, you'll receive more informative messages. Many of the errors support the services and are particularly useful in wireless implementations.

In order to integrate this feature, you need to first declare the `anyhow` crate dependency in your `cargo.toml` and then import it. Afterward, for the `main` function return type, we replace the bang `!` (indicating the function never returns) with `anyhow::Result` . Finally, we can replace all `unwrap` instances for expressions that return a `Result` with the `?` operator. Replacing the expression with [`?`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Try.html) will result in the `Ok` unwrapped value if everything is fine. On the other hand, if the result is [`Err`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#variant.Err), the [`Err`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#variant.Err) value is propagated to the enclosing function (`main` in our case).

***Note* üìù**

> The `anyhow` crate provides support for `no_std` implementations almost all the same API are available and works in a similar manner to `std` implementations. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/) for more detail.

## **üë®‚Äçüíª Code Implementation**

### **üì• Crate Imports**

In this implementation, the following crates are required:

* The `anyhow` crate for error handling.
    
* The `esp_idf_hal` crate to import the peripherals.
    
* The `esp_idf_svc` crate to import the device services (wifi in particular).
    
* The `embedded_svc` crate to import the needed service traits.
    

```rust
use anyhow::{self, Error};
use embedded_svc::wifi::{AuthMethod, ClientConfiguration, Configuration};
use esp_idf_hal::peripherals::Peripherals;
use esp_idf_svc::eventloop::EspSystemEventLoop;
use esp_idf_svc::nvs::EspDefaultNvsPartition;
use esp_idf_svc::wifi::EspWifi;
```

### **üéõ Initialization/Configuration Code**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a handle for the device peripherals**: Similar to all past blog posts, in embedded Rust, as part of the singleton design pattern, we first have to take the device peripherals. This is done using the `take()` method. Here I create a device peripheral handler named `peripherals` as follows:

```rust
let peripherals = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain handle for WiFi driver**: the `esp-idf-svc` [documentation](https://esp-rs.github.io/esp-idf-svc/esp_idf_svc/wifi/index.html) contains more than one struct option to create a WiFi instance. `EspWifi` and `WifiDriver` , `EspWifi` provides a higher OSI model level with features that would ease networking examples later. `EspWifi` also encapsulates a `WifiDriver` within its implementation. Within the `EspWifi` struct, there exists a `new` method to create an instance with the following signature:

```rust
pub fn new<M: WifiModemPeripheral>(
    modem: impl Peripheral<P = M> + 'd,
    sysloop: EspSystemEventLoop,
    nvs: Option<EspDefaultNvsPartition>
) -> Result<Self, EspError>
```

Note it requires three parameters, a modem peripheral, a `EspSystemEventLoop`, and a `EspDefaultNvsPartition` wrapped in an `Option`. Both `EspSystemEventLoop` and `EspDefaultNvsPartition` are singletons types that have a `take` method. As such, we can create handles for each and then pass them as arguments to the `EspWifi` `new` method. Here's the code:

```rust
let sysloop = EspSystemEventLoop::take()?;
let nvs = EspDefaultNvsPartition::take()?;
let mut wifi = EspWifi::new(peripherals.modem, sysloop, Some(nvs))?;
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure the WiFi Driver**: note that `wifi` is still not configured. Also within `EspWifi` there exists a [`set_configuration`](https://esp-rs.github.io/esp-idf-svc/esp_idf_svc/wifi/struct.EspWifi.html#method.set_configuration) method that takes a single `&Configuration` argument. `Configuration` is an enum of structs that looks as follows:

```rust
pub enum Configuration {
    None,
    Client(ClientConfiguration),
    AccessPoint(AccessPointConfiguration),
    Mixed(ClientConfiguration, AccessPointConfiguration),
}
```

Note that there are several options for configuration as discussed earlier. We want to configure the ESP as a client so we're going to go for the `Client` option. Following that, the `ClientConfiguration` struct wrapped inside the `Client` option has the following definition:

```rust
pub struct ClientConfiguration {
    pub ssid: String<32>,
    pub bssid: Option<[u8; 6]>,
    pub auth_method: AuthMethod,
    pub password: String<64>,
    pub channel: Option<u8>,
}
```

Out of the different members, were only going to configure `ssid` which is the network id, `password` which is the network password, and `auth_method` which is the network authentication method. Finally, the rest will be configured with defaults as follows:

```rust
wifi.set_configuration(&Configuration::Client(ClientConfiguration {
    ssid: "SSID".into(),
    password: "PASSWORD".into(),
    auth_method: AuthMethod::None,
    ..Default::default()
}))?;
```

This is it for configuration! Let's now jump into the application code.

### **üì± Application Code**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Start and Connect Wifi**: Now that wifi is configured, all we need to do is `start` it and then `connect` to a network. Both methods are part of the `EspWifi` type:

```rust
// Start Wifi
wifi.start()?;
// Connect Wifi
wifi.connect()?;
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm Connection:** At this point, WiFi should connect to the network and we can confirm the connection. For that, there exists a `is_connected` method returns a `bool` wrapped in a `Result`. We can also get the configuration of the connection using the `get_configuration` method:

```rust
// Wait for connection to happen
while !wifi.is_connected().unwrap() {
    // Get and print connetion configuration
    let config = wifi.get_configuration().unwrap();
    println!("Waiting for station {:?}", config);
}

println!("Connected");
```

This is it! Connecting to WiFi with Rust might have turned out to be easier than you might have thought!

## **üì±Full Application Code**

Here is the full code for the implementation described in this post. You can additionally find the full project and others available on the [**apollolabs ESP32C3**](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/ESP32C3) git repo. Also, the Wokwi project can be accessed [**here**](https://wokwi.com/projects/377102759837433857).

```rust
use anyhow::{self, Error};
use embedded_svc::wifi::{AuthMethod, ClientConfiguration, Configuration};
use esp_idf_hal::peripherals::Peripherals;
use esp_idf_svc::eventloop::EspSystemEventLoop;
use esp_idf_svc::nvs::EspDefaultNvsPartition;
use esp_idf_svc::wifi::EspWifi;

fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    esp_idf_sys::link_patches();

    // Configure Wifi
    let peripherals = Peripherals::take().unwrap();
    let sysloop = EspSystemEventLoop::take()?;
    let nvs = EspDefaultNvsPartition::take()?;

    let mut wifi = EspWifi::new(peripherals.modem, sysloop, Some(nvs))?;

    wifi.set_configuration(&Configuration::Client(ClientConfiguration {
        ssid: "Wokwi-GUEST".into(),
        password: "".into(),
        auth_method: AuthMethod::None,
        ..Default::default()
    }))?;

    // Start Wifi
    wifi.start()?;

    // Connect Wifi
    wifi.connect()?;

    // Confirm Wifi Connection
    while !wifi.is_connected().unwrap() {
        // Get and print connection configuration
        let config = wifi.get_configuration().unwrap();
        println!("Waiting for station {:?}", config);
    }

    println!("Connected");

    Ok(())
}
```
