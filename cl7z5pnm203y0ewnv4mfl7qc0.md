## Introduction

To be honest, this was not a post I was planning on at first. However, I was working on a side project that I needed to use DMA for, and getting it to work with the HAL was thus far the most painful experience I faced in embedded Rust. As a result, I figured I must write about it hoping it would benefit others. What was quite interesting was that, compared to other STM32 peripherals at the HAL, DMA was a different animal. Typically when I struggled with figuring stuff out or finding proper documentation I used to cross over to other STM32 HALs to find insight as there were many similarities. This was not the case for DMA as each HAL seemed to have its own way of doing DMA implementation. 

Well, I guess enough complaining, for now, üòÅ so let me get into it. 

In this post, I will be setting up the STM32F4 DMA engine to collect ADC samples from two microphones and print the values out to the console using UART. I will also be using the RTIC framework that I introduced in my [last post](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-the-rtic-framework). 

%%[substart]

### üìö Knowledge Pre-requisites
To understand the content of this post, you need the following:
- Basic knowledge of coding in Rust.
- Familiarity with the basic RTIC template in Rust.
- Familiarity with DMA engines.
- Familiarity with interrupts in Cortex-M processors.

### üíæ Software Setup
All the code presented in this post in addition to instructions for the environment and toolchain setup are available on the [apollolabsdev Nucleo-F401RE](https://github.com/apollolabsdev/stm32-nucleo-f401re) git repo. Note that if the code on the git repo is slightly different then it means that it was modified to enhance the code quality or accommodate any HAL/Rust updates.

### üõ† Hardware Setup
#### Materials
- 1 x [Nucleo-F401RE board](https://amzn.to/3yn6AIb)

![nucleof401re.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1659779074203/HjlMouvt1.jpg align="center")

- 1 x Seeed Studio [Grove Base Shield V2.0](https://www.seeedstudio.com/base-shield-v2.html)

![Base_Shield_v2-1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1659779892425/x3AcSK-0N.png align="center")

- 2 x Seeed Studio [Analog Microphone](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Analog-Microphone-p-4593.html).

![grovemic.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1662626875658/NaftBM7Be.png align="center")

#### üîå Connections
- The first Microphone signal pin is connected to pin PA0 (Grove Connector A0).
- The second Microphone signal pin is connected to pin PA4 (Grove Connector A2).
- The UART Tx line that connects to the PC through the onboard USB bridge is via pin PA2 on the microcontroller. This is a hardwired pin, meaning you cannot use any other for this setup. Unless you are using a different board other than the Nucleo-F401RE, you have to check the relevant documentation (reference manual or datasheet) to determine the number of the pin.

## üë®‚Äçüé® Software Design
There isn't much of an algorithm design for this application as most of the work is going to be handled by hardware through interrupts. In software, however, we will mainly be configuring the DMA and collecting and processing microphone samples once they become available. 

The state machine below expresses how the application works.

![Screen Shot 2022-09-10 at 11.35.19 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1662798952441/3GttA8Lrq.png align="center")

The application will be sitting idle until a timer interrupt event happens at a rate of our choice (for example every one second). In the timer interrupt task, we will kick off an ADC sequence conversion that will go and collect ADC samples from all microphone channels. The application would then return to the idle state again and wait until a DMA event happens. The DMA event signals that the ADC data is available in memory to read. As such, in the "Transfer Complete" state the application would collect the available data, transmit it, and then return to idle.

**üìù Note**

> An alternative approach would have been to skip the timer interrupt kicking off the ADC conversion altogether and instead have the DMA interrupt collect data directly when it becomes available by the ADC. That would require that the ADC peripheral itself support the behavior in hardware where the next conversion is automatically started (which it is in the stm32f4). This also means that the ADC conversion has to be kicked off right after the configuration is complete.

Let's now jump into the code implementation.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Code Implementation
Note here that I will be using the RTIC framework, so the structure in this section will follow that of an RTIC frame work application (refer to [this](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-the-rtic-framework) post for more detail).

### üì± The `app` module

#### üì• Crate Imports 
In this implementation, the crate imports include the `core::fmt::Write` crate for UART message formatting and the namespaces for all the various types needed from the `stm32f4xx_hal` crate for the ADC, DMA, Timer, and UART.

```rust
    use core::fmt::Write;
    use stm32f4xx_hal::{
        adc::{
            config::{AdcConfig, Clock, Dma, Resolution, SampleTime, Scan, Sequence},
            Adc,
        },
        dma::{config::DmaConfig, PeripheralToMemory, Stream0, StreamsTuple, Transfer},
        pac::{self, ADC1, DMA2, TIM2, USART2},
        prelude::*,
        serial::{config::Config, Tx},
        timer::{CounterHz, Event},
    };
```
Additionally, for convenience, the following alias is created for a DMA transfer:

```rust
type DMATransfer =
        Transfer<Stream0<DMA2>, 0, Adc<ADC1>, PeripheralToMemory, &'static mut [u16; 2]>;
```
This follows the DMA `Transfer` type signature from the `stm32f4xx_hal::dma` module in the [hal documentation](https://docs.rs/stm32f4xx-hal/latest/stm32f4xx_hal/dma/struct.Transfer.html):

```rust
pub struct Transfer<STREAM, const CHANNEL: u8, PERIPHERAL, DIRECTION, BUF>
```
More detail on the individual members will follow in the DMA configuration section, so if this is still not clear don't worry.

#### üóÑ Shared Resources
In the `Shared` struct the only entity that needs to be allocated as a shared resource is 'transfer' which is of type `DMATransfer`.  `transfer` will be needed by the DMA interrupt task/ISR to enable access tp the DMA and retrieve the converted ADC data. Additionally, `transfer` will be needed by the timer interrupt task to kick off the next ADC conversion as `transfer` will own the ADC peripheral.

```rust
    #[shared]
    struct Shared {     
        transfer: DMATransfer,
    }
```

#### üìÅ Local Resources 
In the 'Local'  resources struct I include the USART transmitter, the timer counter, and finally, the buffer that the DMA will utilize. Note that the type of `buffer` is `Option<&'static mut [u16; 2]>` which also will be explained in more detail downstream.

```rust
    #[local]
    struct Local {
        tx: Tx<USART2>,
        buffer: Option<&'static mut [u16; 2]>,
        timer: CounterHz<TIM2>,
    }
```
`tx` and `buffer` will be utilized only by the DMA interrupt task, and `timer` will be utilized only by the timer interrupt task.

### The `#[init]` Task

Note that compared to prior posts where I was not using the RTIC, the `#[init]` task essentially replicates the configuration part of the code.

In the application, I'll be using two buffers for DMA. The way it works is that the DMA will fill the first buffer and trigger an interrupt when it's done. At that point, the DMA will need a second buffer to start the next transfer with, making the first buffer available to extract data from. Since the DMA will be running for the whole application time, I'd need to pre-allocate `'static` buffers that live for the life of the program and can cross tasks. From the [RTIC documentation](https://rtic.rs/1/book/en/by-example/tips_static_lifetimes.html), it is stated that creating `local` resources in `#[init]` and `#[idle]` give them `'static` lifetimes. As such, two `[u16; 2]` buffers are allocated in `#[init]` as follows:

```rust
#[init(local = [first_buffer: [u16; 2] = [0; 2],second_buffer: [u16; 2] = [0; 2]])]
```
The size of the buffers are `[u16; 2]` because the ADC generates a `u16` result and there will be two values/samples to buffer per transaction. One from the first microphone and another from the second microphone.

#### üéõ Peripheral Configuration
To access the device peripherals conveniently I create a `dp` handle as follows:

```rust
let dp: pac::Peripherals = cx.device;
```
#### üï∞ Clocks Configuration

To configure the clocks, as I have done several times before in prior posts, the `RCC` peripheral needs to be first constrained to access the `cfgr` struct. The different clocks are then configured before they are frozen using the `freeze` method as follows:

```rust
        let rcc = dp.RCC.constrain();
        let clocks = rcc
            .cfgr
            .use_hse(8.MHz())
            .sysclk(84.MHz())
            .hclk(84.MHz())
            .require_pll48clk()
            .pclk2(21.MHz())
            .freeze();
```
**üìù Note**

> If you are wondering how I obtained the clock values there are several ways. Some clocks are fixed and given by the board I am using like the `hse` but others need to be calculated based on the clock tree configuration required. One could resort to the reference manual but that might be prone to errors. I instead leverage the [CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) tool by STMicroelectronics to configure the clocks in the way I need and then copy over the values to my code.

#### üïπ ADC Configuration

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain handles and configure the microphone signal pins PA0 and PA4:** this is similar to what I've done before [here](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-analog-temperature-sensing-using-the-adc):

```rust
        let gpioa = dp.GPIOA.split();
        // PA0 maps to A0 on Grove Base Shield
        // PA4 maps to A2 on Grove Base Shield
        let mic1 = gpioa.pa0.into_analog();
        let mic2 = gpioa.pa4.into_analog();
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure the ADC Peripheral:** for configuring the ADC, in the [past post](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-analog-temperature-sensing-using-the-adc), I went for the default configuration. Here, I can't do that because I need to change the scan mode and also enable the dma. I create an `adc_config` handle that I will pass later when I initialize the ADC function as follows:

```rust
        let adc_config = AdcConfig::default()
            .dma(Dma::Continuous)
            .scan(Scan::Enabled)
            .resolution(Resolution::Ten)
            .clock(Clock::Pclk2_div_8);
```
Here `Dma`, `Scan`, and `Clock`, are all enums containing configuration options. The `dma` method is changes the config to  `Continous` mode. This enables the DMA to continuously obtain ADC readings.  The `scan` method is enabling scan mode configuring the ADC to "scan" all channels and generate a result. The `resolution` method is changing the resolution to 10. Finally, the clock method is introducing a clock divider to slow down (reduce) the ADC clock frequency by a factor of 8. There's actually no particular reason why I've done the clock slow down, I only wanted to experiment. Typically though, one would alternate the clock to control the sample rate of the ADC.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Initialize ADC peripheral and obtain handle:** This is exactly the same as what I have done in an earlier [post](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-analog-temperature-sensing-using-the-adc) and is as follows:
```rust
let mut adc = Adc::adc1(dp.ADC1, true, adc_config);
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure individual Channels:** This is something new. Since I'll be doing scan mode, the individual channels (one for each microphone) need to be configured. This is because the ADC needs to know two things about each channel; the sequence order and the sample time. This is because the STM32 allows one to control the order in which samples are taken in a scan sequence in addition to the sample time per channel. To do that there is a `configure_channel` method in the stm32f4xx-hal documentation that has the following signature:

```rust
pub fn configure_channel<CHANNEL>(
    &mut self,
    _channel: &CHANNEL,
    sequence: Sequence,
    sample_time: SampleTime
)
```
As such, I am required to pass a reference to the channel, the sequence order for that channel, and finally the sample time. This results in the following code:

```rust
        adc.configure_channel(&mic1, Sequence::One, SampleTime::Cycles_480);
        adc.configure_channel(&mic2, Sequence::Two, SampleTime::Cycles_480);
```

For each channel, in the first parameter, I pass the handler for each of the microphones (channel to configure). Next, `sequence` is passed a `Sequence` enum that defines where in the sequence to sample the channel at hand. Finally, `sample_time` is passed a `SampleTime` enum that contains all the sample time defining how many clock cycles to sample for. These values come from the datasheet in which I am configuring each channel to take 480 clock cycles to acquire a sample.

#### üßÆ Serial Configuration

The serial configuration remains exactly the same as I've done several times before in prior posts (the original post for configuring serial is [here](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-uart-serial-communication)):

```rust
        // Configure/Define TX pin
        // Use PA2 as it is connected to the host serial interface
        // let gpioa = dp.GPIOA.split();
        let tx_pin = gpioa.pa2.into_alternate();
        // Configure Serial perihperal channel
        // We're going to use USART2 since its pins are the ones connected to the USART host interface
        let tx = dp
            .USART2
            .tx(
                tx_pin,
                Config::default()
                    .baudrate(115200.bps())
                    .wordlength_8()
                    .parity_none(),
                &clocks,
            )
            .unwrap();
```

#### ‚è≥ Timer Configuration

I'll need a timer as mentioned earlier to kick off the ADC conversion at regular intervals. to configure the timer it needs to be initialized to obtain a handle, then set up a listener to generate interrupts on update events, and finally, start the timer with a 1000 Hz interrupt rate. This is done in the following lines (for more detail refer to [timer interrupt post](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-timer-interrupts)):

```rust
        let mut timer = dp.TIM2.counter_hz(&clocks);
        timer.listen(Event::Update);
        timer.start(1000.Hz()).unwrap();
```

#### üöÇ DMA Configuration

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Split and obtain a handle for DMA:** Each DMA consists of multiple streams, sort of like how GPIO consists of multiple pins per port. To obtain access to the streams we have to do something similar to `split` and `constrain` used with `GPIO` and `RCC` (I talked about `split` and `constrain` in more detail [here](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/demystifying-rust-embedded-hal-split-and-constrain-methods)). This is done using the `StreamsTuple::new` method which splits the DMA peripheral into streams (why the method wasn't called `split` beats me, just one of the inconsistencies in DMA I referred to earlier). The `new` method has the following signature which simply takes a DMA instance:

```rust
pub fn new(_regs: DMA) -> Self
```
I will be using `DMA2` since according to the reference manual it is the entity that connects to `ADC1`. I create a `dma` handle as follows:

```rust
let dma = StreamsTuple::new(dp.DMA2);
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure DMA:** Similar to other peripherals that need configuration like the ADC, there is a default configuration that exists. One would only need to modify the parts that need to change. As I had expressed in earlier posts, in order to access what the default configuration was, I had to always dig into the source code. Here is the default configuration I've found:

```rust
    impl Default for DmaConfig {
        fn default() -> Self {
            Self {
                priority: Priority::Medium,
                memory_increment: false,
                peripheral_increment: false,
                transfer_complete_interrupt: false,
                half_transfer_interrupt: false,
                transfer_error_interrupt: false,
                direct_mode_error_interrupt: false,
                fifo_error_interrupt: false,
                double_buffer: false,
                fifo_threshold: FifoThreshold::QuarterFull,
                fifo_enable: false,
                memory_burst: BurstMode::NoBurst,
                peripheral_burst: BurstMode::NoBurst,
            }
        }
    }
``` 

Also similar to other peripherals, [the hal dma documentation](https://docs.rs/stm32f4xx-hal/latest/stm32f4xx_hal/dma/config/struct.DmaConfig.html) provides methods that allow modifying the individual fields. For my purposes, there are only two fields that need to be changed. `transfer_complete_interrupt` has to be made true so that I get an interrupt after the completion of each DMA transaction. Also `memory_increment` needs to be made true so that the DMA increments memory addresses for the new data by itself. For more details on DMA in the stm32f4 devices, I highly recommend reading [this](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/dm00046011-using-the-stm32f2-stm32f4-and-stm32f7-series-dma-controller-stmicroelectronics.pdf) application note. Using the appropriate methods, a `dma_config` handle is created to contain the DMA config and looks as follows:

```rust
        let dma_config = DmaConfig::default()
            .transfer_complete_interrupt(true)
            .memory_increment(true);
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Initialize DMA transfer and create handle:** This is the final step in the configuration where I need to initialize the type of transfer we want the DMA to do. DMAs can do peripheral to memory, memory to memory, and memory to peripheral transfers. Here I need a peripheral (the ADC) to memory transfer. In the [documentation](https://docs.rs/stm32f4xx-hal/latest/stm32f4xx_hal/dma/struct.Transfer.html) under the `dma::Transfer` struct implementation there is an `init_peripheral_to_memory` method with the following signature: 

```rust
pub fn init_peripheral_to_memory(
    stream: STREAM,
    peripheral: PERIPHERAL,
    buf: BUF,
    double_buf: Option<BUF>,
    config: DmaConfig
) -> Self
```

Resulting in the following initialization under the handle `transfer`:

```rust
        let transfer = Transfer::init_peripheral_to_memory(
            dma.0,
            adc,
            cx.local.first_buffer,
            None,
            dma_config,
        );
```
The `stream` argument passes `dma.0` which corresponds to stream 0 that is connected to `adc1`, the `peripheral` argument passes the initialized `adc` handle created earlier, the `buf` argument passes the `first_buffer` buffer declared in the local resources of the `#[init]` task, `double_buf` is passed `None`, and finally `config` is passed the `dma_config` handle created earlier containing the dma configuration.  Note that double buffering is a dma feature that I'm not using and the documentation states that one should pass `None` when not in use.

#### Return Resources

Remember that at the end of the init task, the initialized values for the system-wide `#[shared]` and `#[local]` resources defined earlier must be returned. This looks as follows:

```rust 
        (
            Shared { transfer },
            Local {
                tx,
                buffer: Some(cx.local.second_buffer),
                timer,
            },
            init::Monotonics(),
        )
```

Note how `second_buffer` got wrapped with an `Option`. This needed to be done as I've defined the `buffer` type earlier in the resources section as `Option<&'static mut [u16; 2]>`. Though why does `second_buffer` need to be wrapped with an `Option`? Please read on.

### The Timer Interrupt Task (ADC Start State)
The timer interrupt task is the one accessed whenever a `TIM2` timer event expiry happens. Earlier this was defined in the configuration to fire at a rate of 1kHz. Additionally, in the timer interrupt task, I will need to access the `transfer` shared resource and the `timer` local resource. All that needs to be done in the task to start a DMA transfer and the ADC conversion and clear the timer interrupt flag. Note that the adc peripheral is now owned by `transfer` so the adc methods are only accessible through the `transfer` handle. To start a DMA transfer the [hal](https://docs.rs/stm32f4xx-hal/latest/stm32f4xx_hal/dma/struct.Transfer.html#method.start) provides a `start` method with the following signature:

```rust
source
pub fn start<F>(&mut self, f: F)
where
    F: FnOnce(&mut PERIPHERAL), 
```
This method provides a closure with a token to access the owned peripheral (in this case the ADC). As such, the timer interrupt task code looks as follows:

```rust
 #[task(binds = TIM2, shared = [transfer], local = [timer])]
    fn adcstart(mut cx: adcstart::Context) {
        cx.shared.transfer.lock(|transfer| {
            transfer.start(|adc| {
                adc.start_conversion();
            });
        });
        cx.local.timer.clear_interrupt(Event::Update);
    }
```
Note how the `transfer` resource had to be locked before it could be used since it is a shared resource. As such there are two levels of closures, the first closure provides a token to the locked resource `transfer`, and the second nested closure provides access to the transfer peripheral. Also, the `clear_interrupt` part is the same as what has been done before in the [STM32F4 Embedded Rust at the HAL: The RTIC Framework](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/series/stm32f4-embedded-rust-hal) post.

### The DMA Interrupt Task (DMA Start State)
This is the last part of the code and where things get interesting when the DMA interrupt happens. The DMA interrupt indicates that a transfer has been completed and now there is data stored in memory that needs to be collected.  Looking into the [documentation](https://docs.rs/stm32f4xx-hal/latest/stm32f4xx_hal/dma/struct.Transfer.html#method.start) again, we find a `next_transfer` method with the following signature:

```rust
pub fn next_transfer(
    &mut self,
    new_buf: BUF
) -> Result<(BUF, CurrentBuffer), DMAError<BUF>>
```
What this method does is provide a buffer (`first_buffer` we started the transfer with) filled with data collected from the ADC and takes a new buffer (`second_buffer` ) to start the next transfer with. The new buffer is passed through the`new_buf` parameter and the data collected is returned in the `Result<(BUF, CurrentBuffer), DMAError<BUF>>`. Note that `CurrentBuffer` is relative to the double buffering feature that we aren't using so all I need is `BUF`. 

To implement the code, first, the task is defined by binding the `DMA2_STREAM0` interrupt that maps to the stream that connects the ADC:

```rust
#[task(binds = DMA2_STREAM0, shared = [transfer], local = [tx, buffer])]
```
The `DMA2_STREAM0` name comes from the interrupt enum list for the stm32f4xx-hal. The task attribute also includes the list of resources that will be used in the implementation. This includes `buffer` that contains the second buffer that will be passed to the next rransfer. After that, for convenience, handles for the share and local resources are created:

```rust
let mut shared = ctx.shared;
let local = ctx.local;
```
As before, access to the `next_transfer` method needs to happen through the shared `transfer` resource so it needs to be locked before use resulting in the following:

```rust
        let buffer = shared.transfer.lock(|transfer| {
            let (buffer, _) = transfer
                .next_transfer(local.buffer.take().unwrap())
                .unwrap();
            buffer
        });
```
Note what is being passed to `next_transfer` which is `local.buffer.take().unwrap()`. This is why I earlier defined the `buffer` type as an `Option<&'static mut [u16; 2]>`. Here I am passing ownership of `local.buffer` to `transfer` using the `take()` method and leaving `None` in its place, then I use the `unwrap()` method to unwrap the `Option` and pass the buffer. Now, thinking about it, `local.buffer` has a `None` left inside of it. So when the next interrupt happens, at this point there is no new buffer to provide. But what was that done? The thing is that at this point is that the other buffer I'm using now tied to the `buffer` handle that was passed back by the dma transfer, and still has the data I want.  I cannot give up ownership until I get the data I need. As a result, I would need to empty `buffer` first before making it available again in the resource pool for the next DMA transfer. On a side note, something important to realize here is that `next_transfer` also clears the dma interrupt so no special method needs to be called to do that.

To empty `buffer`, which is the buffer passed by the dma, I wrote the following code:

```rust
        let mic1 = buffer[0];
        let mic2 = buffer[1];
```
As might be obvious already, the adc collected data from multiple channels is provided back in a contiguous piece of memory (the reason why I declared the buffer as a `[u16;2]`). Here the data is mapped starting at index 0 to the sequence order provided earlier in the adc channel config. `buffer[0]` maps to the channel configured as `Sequence::One` and `buffer[1]` to `Sequence::Two`. 

Now that the data has been obtained, the old buffer, `buffer` can be wrapped in a `Some` and written back to `local.buffer` in the resource pool so that it's available for the next transfer:
 
```rust
        // Return buffer to resources pool for next transfer
        *local.buffer = Some(buffer);
```
Finally, the ADC results are transmitted over UART using the `writeln!` macro:

```rust
        // Send over data to UART
        writeln!(local.tx, "/*{:02},{:02}*/\r", mic1, mic2).unwrap();
    }
```

 ## üî¨ Further Experimentation/Ideas
- Expand on this code such that the UART transmission is also handled by the DMA.  
- Add more ADC channels and expand the code to handle them.
- Convert the [Analog Temperature Sensing Application](https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/stm32f4-embedded-rust-at-the-hal-analog-temperature-sensing-using-the-adc) introduced before to handled by DMA. 
- Refactor the existing code to run without the RTIC framework.

## Conclusion
In this post, the sm32f4xx-hal DMA was leveraged to create an application that collects ADC samples from two microphones without processor interference. The code relies on interrupts and utilizes the RTIC framework as well. Creating DMA applications has proven to be a bit more challenging than other peripherals thus far due to the lack of consistency in approach among various stm hals. The application was created leveraging the STM32F401RE microcontroller on the Nucleo-F401RE development board. All code was created at the HAL level using the stm32f4xx Rust HAL.
